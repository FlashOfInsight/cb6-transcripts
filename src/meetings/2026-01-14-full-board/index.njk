or you have no
[SPEAKER]: All right. Our elected officials sent in
their reports ahead of time and they are
compiled on the CB6 website. The links
to the the link to the reports was sent
out ahead of time for your convenience
and can be found in the chat on Zoom or
by going to our website's page for full
board meetings. I will call in each of
the elected officials who have RSVPd so
they can take questions from CB6 members
and the public with um about their
reports. Each elected official will be
able to field questions. If there are no
questions, we will move on to our next
official on our list. Um if there's a
time-sensitive matter, they will uh
report that didn't make it into their
presubmitted their report, they will do
so. We have the honor of having our new
burough president, Bradman Hoyman
Seagull, with us this evening.
Thank you. Thank you. Good to see
everyone. Thank you very much. Hello,
Jerry. I text
Brad Eagles. Good to see everyone. Uh
your 28th Manhattanboro president and
I'm happy to be here to welcome everyone
to the new year uh to my new year uh and
give you a short report. First, I want
to introduce a couple of colleagues who
are here. Uh we have a new director of
community affairs, Marielle Ali, who is
here. Say hello to Marielle.
[SPEAKER]: Hello.
[SPEAKER]: And everyone knows the amazing Vera
Rosenberg who's been our amaz. So say
hello.
[SPEAKER]: Um the first and biggest news is that
community board applications
begin in earnest. They will start and go
live this Friday, January 16th. uh
that'll be due at the end of February,
February 27th. So, um look for that.
We'll make sure that you get the link
and the application is very similar to
the past, but um we'll help walk you
through the process if any current or
prospective board members have
questions. Uh secondly, we're planning
um an inauguration celebration and more
important than that, a burough
convention. It's our vision to gather uh
community [clears throat] boards and
other stakeholders together on February
22nd. That's a Sunday. Uh from 1 to 4:00
p.m. It's going to be at Alice Tony Hall
at Lincoln Center. That's Broadway and
65th Street. There's some little flags
in the back, but [clears throat]
it's going to be
collective community agenda setting
meeting. uh you know with the big postit
notepads facilitators and an opportunity
for uh people to let the new Manhattan
president office know about what's on
their mind and what they want to see us
address. So I think it's an earnest
attempt to really rely on our community
partners to help drive the agenda out of
office. So that's the way I see it and I
welcome everyone to participate in that.
And then finally just wanted to say that
um we've uh filled out a number of
positions in our office and we'll be
making announcements soon for deputy
president and other posts including
director of land use and planning which
is a very important officer. So look
forward [clears throat] to working with
each and every one of you moving forward
and um happy new year again. Thank you
so much.
[SPEAKER]: Do we have time for any questions?
[SPEAKER]: I have a weird echo here. I don't really
talk to any.
[SPEAKER]: So, as I'm sure you know, the city
charter uh charges the uh the executive
department.
you're supposed to provide information
when we have to for it. Um the reality
isn't quite so pretty. Um we have been
asked on several occasions to
departments even though we're a city
agency. Um so my first question is how
can your office help us get these
agencies to cooperate? And secondly, um,
many departments no longer like to pay
overtime. We meet in the evening. Many
of the people in those departments with
whom you want to speak only work during
the day. So they will not make them
available to us. So how can we address
that? Well, on the first question about
uh our council member Harvey Epstein is
here. I'd love to work with the council
member on perhaps a legislative response
to making certain that community boards
get the information they need and don't
have to resort to foil. That said,
please view my office working in
conjunction with council member epste as
leverage to get that information as
quickly as possible. Um, I know that
Marielle and Broa would be really
responsive to a community for request
um, in that regard as would I. So, let's
work in conjunction to get you
[clears throat] the information you need
and let's look at a legislative
potential
solution as well.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER]: Yeah, already.
[SPEAKER]: That's right. But in terms of requiring
you to foil, maybe we need um
clarification.
[SPEAKER]: Okay, we're good at asking us.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER]: Marty has a question.
as I've asked your predecessors for the
last 35 years.
[SPEAKER]: The board after a few months
when the initial new members come in,
starts losing members by the end of the
term we're generally down 10.
And I've asked your predecessors
since you [clears throat] had this uh
dugout full of people who really want to
come on the board [clears throat] to
while there's a an a opening during the
year to get somebody on so that the
committees don't have to work with much
fewer [clears throat] people than we
really need.
[SPEAKER]: Marty, we have a new member this
evening.
[SPEAKER]: Okay.
[SPEAKER]: That was just assigned to the board. But
I I completely agree that we have to
make quorum. Let's start with that. And
if it's hard to make quum because
members aren't being replaced and I
think it also goes to the initial
appointment process that we make sure we
appoint community members who are
committed to it and understand what
they're getting into. Um so there's a
couple of ways to approach that, but
certainly um being responsive to
vacancies I think is really important. I
take it seriously. I was a community
board member for a decade. I chair for
three years. Uh so I like
[SPEAKER]: I know
and I hear on that. So let's make
certain that we are responsive to that.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER]: Great. Hope any other questions. Well,
um I'm sure we'll think of something.
Thank you. See you soon. Thank you.
Um
Next we have our new council member
Harvey.
[SPEAKER]: Want me over there? You want me
[SPEAKER]: whatever you like
being over here. So I'm gonna come over
here.
[SPEAKER]: Your hometown.
Want to thank our president Bradle.
I know his presence is going to be
missed in Albany. We'll be very very
lucky to have our president. Thank you.
But you went to Aldi yesterday. I didn't
go.
[SPEAKER]: And just so you know that, you know,
community boards, I think you should be
really feel comfortable reaching out to
his office. It's going to be an ally. We
need to get replacements for our seats.
I know Brad's committed to that. He and
I both served on community boards very
long time. Both former chairs of board,
so we know how important community
boards are. And if you do have to figure
out this a legislative fix, it might
just be trying to get it directly from
the mayor's office and we try to push
that as well. So there way we can figure
that out together. Happy to. Um so I
want to introduce [clears throat] Ben.
Is this your first meeting?
[SPEAKER]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER]: Second meeting. Okay. I want to
introduce Ben from my team who's going
to be our community board six lon. Ben
is great. He really cares about this
community, cares for these issues. Reach
out to him in our newsletter. Everyone's
email. Um, it's in the back page of
newsletter. I think there's they're on
the back page. Yeah. So, if you need
your questions, we're all there.
Everyone's email. So, you can reach out
to all of us. So, you have questions.
Want to talk about things that are going
on in the last month. It feels like you
know when I was in the assembly I came
in doesn't feel that much different but
I'll just so I know earlier in the week
we had a rally trying to con I don't
know if people saw the con has proposed
you know increases again this year in
addition to the 25% increase they've got
in the last 5 years we had over 110
elected officials sign on to this letter
that we uh we sent to the public service
commission they're voting later this
month we're encouraging the mayor to
oppose this increase, you know, the idea
that, you know, people who are
struggling right now are struggling. And
my new colleague Virginia Maloney walked
in the door. [laughter]
[SPEAKER]: He started rocking today. Virginia.
Um, so you know, Virginia and I were
were at this kind of press uh conference
and we're really hopeful that the mayor
along with other elected officials can
convince the governor and the public
service commission to oppose the
increase and review all we can do.
Really appreciate that. Um, also I don't
know if you heard earlier this week
staffer of the city council was um by
ICE who was at a press conference
earlier in the week with the speaker um
Julie Menon and yesterday we had a press
conference again with the the staff of
the the council. Um it rang just that
someone who's here legally, you know,
has working papers, works for the city
council, went for an appointment and was
detained even though they have a job.
They have connections here. It's really
just another outrageous what's happening
with ICE happened the other day on
Seventh Street just you know 10 minutes
from here. Someone's just picked up at
their place and employment. So what I
doing not just in New York but obviously
around the country is really really
despicable and it's you know I think we
it's really incumbent upon us to stand
up and speak out on these issues.
[SPEAKER]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER]: Um and we you know our inauguration
launch great things
youth council you can read it if you
want in the newsletter. Um yeah, had
some fun times because we got multist,
you know, if you haven't lost your tree
yet, you still want to do it, I
encourage you to do that. Um there's we
spent a little time um talking about you
the last couple weeks because you know
what the new mayor said is things we
talked about this be her program deal
with me pressures and where these holes
are and I think it's really important to
try to figure out how to fix those holes
in the system. I know Senator Gonzalez
and I have been talking a lot about
this. So, there's there's some really
important legislative fixes. If you
[clears throat] pay attention to
tomorrow, there'll be some announcements
on the city council, by the way, where
uh all the new members, all the
committee assignments, chair
assignments, all this stuff. So, that's
going to go public tomorrow. And if you
have questions, you know, please ask or
please ask Ben, my office. We want to
make sure we continue to be available
for this community. And if the chair
allows, I'll take a question,
[SPEAKER]: please. Well, we've got three.
[SPEAKER]: Tanya, do you want to go first?
[SPEAKER]: Hi, Harvey. It's so great to see you.
Um, what is the justification? What are
they trying to explain as the increase,
the double digits increase on utilities?
Because oil is at $60 a barrel. I mean,
it's it's not like we're going through
an oil crisis. Is this the um AI centers
that's pushing this? What is it?
[SPEAKER]: You know, it's interesting because we
haven't seen spikes in usage in New York
City, you know, and honestly 70% of uh
outside New York City uh
connectors
are to 9.4% profits. So like if they're
getting their shareholders 9.4% profits
of 150,000 New Yorkers last year the
utility shut off in the balance. I'd
rather get less profits and make sure
people keep their utilities on. You know
500,000 New Yorkers are behind. It's
just to me what we said is just really a
money grab by KED and I think we need to
stop them in their tracks. We talked a
lot about affordability. you know, it's
rent and utilities and that's what
affordability is about and I, you know,
kind of shouldn't be able to get away
with this.
[SPEAKER]: How can we stop?
[SPEAKER]: Well, we testify, we've written letters,
you encourage the mayor to support us. I
think that would be really helpful. The
board wants to pass resolutions and
their exec committee. You know, it's
really important to kind of fight this
increase and to stop the service
commission from allowing this to happen.
[SPEAKER]: Thank you.
Ann and then Brook you had a question
too. You can just
[SPEAKER]: since you mentioned Bernard a couple of
months ago we did pass a resolution in
support of it and expanding it but um
the earlier mayoral administration had
frozen it like no funding no expansion.
Are you saying that the new
administration is working on expanding
and how are they going to fund it? like
any do you have any other details?
[SPEAKER]: Yeah, we talked to the mayor about this
and he's deeply committed to doing it
and moving towards a beard model and
creating a new 911 system which you know
allows people who need adult
professionals to get those people who
need social workers or the domestic
violence situation and people who need
police because of violence can get
different people to come out. So, it's
really restructuring 911. I've talked to
the may personally about it. is very
excited about doing it. I don't know the
time frame to do it, but my expectations
in in this year's budget, I think it'll
be a commitment from all of us.
[SPEAKER]: Great. Ann has has a question.
[SPEAKER]: Um, yeah, to just to follow up on
Tanya's question also, I mean, I don't
even buy I have to buy buy energy
distributed by K, [clears throat] but I
do not buy their energy, right? Right. I
use an ask and still they are like 60%
of the expense. It's it's crazy. So I
wonder if there are opportunities for
restructuring of that as well. And I did
not know about the
[SPEAKER]: commitment to their shareholders. I feel
like damn I saw you.
[SPEAKER]: You know we worked hard as you know in a
different hat when I was in worked hard
in trying to restructure kind of and the
public service commission and it was
really really hard to do because I
entrenched interest on the city level.
We really have little oversight over
kind so we can do [clears throat] what
we can but it you know and I think it's
is hard to do and kind basically has a
monopoly
[SPEAKER]: right
[SPEAKER]: which is why we should be able to
regulate them as a higher standard than
you know somebody that is operating in a
theoretically
[SPEAKER]: and that's what the public service
commission was set up to do to regulate
them and as the understand uh increases.
[SPEAKER]: My other question was actually about the
city council staffer that was detained
still detained.
[SPEAKER]: Still detained.
He's originally from Venezuela. He was
steered legally. He, you know, worked
and said he was [clears throat] showing
up for a regular appointment. He's still
detained. And the message coming out of
the Trump administration is horrific.
Never no criminal history, no nothing.
And they're just saying we're keeping
him. is dangerous.
[SPEAKER]: Don't show up for an appointment.
[SPEAKER]: Right. That's the message. If you show
up going actually to 26 photo tomorrow
with a constituent who's got a 9:00 a.m.
appointment,
[SPEAKER]: they have they're in a tough spot. They
either show up and potentially get
picked up or they don't show up and then
they risk getting picked up. There's no
winning.
[SPEAKER]: So, I'm going to go with them tomorrow
morning at 9:00 a.m. because at least I
can put my body in front of theirs.
Awful.
Cert
has a question up here too.
[SPEAKER]: You can have it. [laughter]
[SPEAKER]: First of all, congratulations. And
switching gears a little bit. The mayor
and the governor together this week have
press conference or earlier what we call
child early childhood education. And I
was wondering whether any mechanisms
[clears throat]
for implementing that in its early days
have been identified and also wondering
whether there's room you know for a
community board to play. I know Dan
Garney and Ben Kalos are so active in
getting seats
[SPEAKER]: for [clears throat] this the district
you know years ago. Is there any role
that the community board could play in
that?
[SPEAKER]: I I think people know that you know 3K
and 3K is pretty up and running in our
neighborhood. So, it's really expanded
to it'll be the two case seats that
we're going to look to expand and
whatever the board can do to help um
support uh council member Money, myself,
Senator Gonzalez, you know, we'll have
an assembly member soon, not yet, but
you will um and force to make sure that
you know communities [clears throat]
across the city get heard. It's going to
be the state budget to be on how much
money we have and then we figure that
out how we're going to allocate it on
the city side. But I'm optimistic.
[SPEAKER]: [clears throat]
[SPEAKER]: All right, we have two more questions.
Maya would had her hand up and then and
then
[SPEAKER]: um I had a question about what the
city's looking at as far as so we've
been asking about if the city docks are
upgrading them to be electrified so they
can get recharged at the station around.
Um so in relation to the company trying
to increase the price of energy how that
relates to they're trying to electrify
this become in this more
[SPEAKER]: yeah I mean electrification and
increased energy cost you know some
really difficult thing because we need
more power because we're using more
electricity we're moving to more EV
vehicles we got
to put more charging infrastructure in
place we're also going to need that path
to plan ahead they increase their capac
capacity. Obviously, we had some browns
over the summer again this year. So,
it's a capacity issue that and I try to
name the client interview to hear about,
but they know this is our commitment and
they're the ones responsible putting,
you know, charging infrastructure in the
city. That's there's
given them that authority. So, they know
that they need to increase capacity and
increase load.
[clears throat]
[SPEAKER]: Rashman, I think is our our last
question. I can hold up your
It's a great water bottle. Everyone that
[SPEAKER]: Oh, and hand sanitizer.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER]: To ask what John said this week, just I
think it was yesterday, a couple of
friends called me. They were trying to
get their children into KC and they
called me because they're like, "How do
we get in touch with the mayor's
office?" Apparently, there's a kiosk
where there's a QR code, sign up, we
have funding, but then when they go to
the website, the website's not working,
and then you're on hold for a couple of
hours when you try to call. Okay.
[SPEAKER]: So, I told them to reach out to their
council member, and you were actually in
Virginia district. So, I put [laughter]
them in, but I just want to bring that
up.
[SPEAKER]: Yeah, that's good. Virginia on the spot
when she
[SPEAKER]: But yeah, that's if they have problems
with that, then we should be hearing it.
We can talk to you know they all we have
governmental contacts in the mayor's
office. We can be reaching out to them
directly to talk about the
[SPEAKER]: addition easier to get in touch with the
council rather than the mayor's office.
[SPEAKER]: Sure it's a little but true
[SPEAKER]: right
[SPEAKER]: you guys sponsor sponsor exactly on the
grounds. Thank you all for letting me
take so much your time and I hope
everyone has a good January and I'll see
you all soon. Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER]: And now we have council member Virginia
Maloney.
[SPEAKER]: Thank you. I'm glad we had Barbie go
before me and all the tough questions.
I'm in the clear. But um I'm Virginia
Maloney and I'm really grateful to be
here as your council person to represent
District 4.
I'm a lifelong Manhattanite and grew up
on the east side of Manhattan and I'm
just very excited. So thank you for
having me here for my first community
board meeting as officially an elected
official.
Congratulations. I'm very lucky to get
to work with such great colleagues like
former assembly member, now council
member Barbie and we as mentioned have
already hit the ground running um
partnering on things that matter to this
community which where we share border
including the coned press conference
earlier this week or was it last it was
last week this week Monday. So all the
already bl together.
[SPEAKER]: Yeah. So thank you again Harvey for
organizing that and for being here
tonight. I also want to take a moment to
recognize my predecessor Keith Powers
who was my council member for eight
years and we can give him
[clears throat] a round of applause. I'd
like to add
that he consistently showed up for
community board 6 and his offer
delivered real long-term results.
everything from tenants protection and
affordability advocacy to cutting
through red tape with agencies when
issues stall. Many of you got to work
with him directly and that kind of
follow through matters and being
available and accountable matters. So
I'm going to continue in that tradition
of public service over the next four
years and I'm grateful to call him a
friend and a confidant. We also had a
surprise visit in our new office this
week in Dan Robnik who came by to pick
up some artwork and share some stage
advice to to our team. Um so we've had
phenomenal examples of public servants
that have represented this district and
I hope to meet that same bar. Uh we kind
of heard a bit about what's been going
on in the council, but it's uh not been
a slow two weeks. I'm on day 14 on the
job. Um but we already stood up to
rising utility rates. Um I was at the
state of the state yesterday where I
heard from the governor about her
priorities and how those will impact the
city. everything from affordability,
which we all know is really top of mind
for New Yorkers, to AI policy that she's
planning to roll out at the state level
to protect um protect people and also be
just be more transparent when AI is
being used particularly in the case of
political ads. Um, let's see. We had a
briefing from the Spark Life Sciences to
learn more about that project and I know
you all will be invited to attend the
briefing on the 21st. Um, and we've had
two tenants association meetings. So,
both with Stason Peter Grouper Village,
and I was in this room just last night
at this same time talking to the
Wateride tenants. Um, so it's been a
busy busy few weeks, two weeks. Um, but
we are just getting started. The most
important update is that our office is
open. So, I want you all to know that we
are keeping Keith Powers's office for
the near term. So, you'll know where to
find us if you've been there before. And
it's the same building, right?
[SPEAKER]: Yes.
[SPEAKER]: Yeah. I'm on the 12th floor. Um, so it
still says keep powers on the door, but
we're working we're working on changing
that. But, um, I will be there and I
want to take a minute to introduce our
team. So, Isabella,
[SPEAKER]: hi everyone. My name is Isabella Sano.
I'll be working in constituent services
and in community affairs for the office.
Um, I'm an east side resident. Um, I'm
also an attorney, soon to be public. Uh,
so we're going to invite you into our
office for any of your notary public
needs.
So, moving forward, either I will be
here or a member of my team will be at
community board meetings. Uh, some other
familiar faces. Shelby Garner is the
chief of staff. Um, Bree Pair is going
to be doing community affairs. And um
Anna Barrett who was on uh my campaign
team is doing comms for legislation and
budget. Sophie Sakor who works with
worked with Alex Gores's office has
joined our team. So we've got an
all-star group. Um we're hiring for
constituent services. Um but we are up
and running. Uh you can email us at
district4selic.gov
which is the same email that you could
reach that and the phone number is the
same. So, we're just just a slight
difference, a different person there.
But, um, I'm really thrilled that Keith
will hopefully continue to serve in
Albany and we'll continue to have a
really strong partner and advocate for
the district. In that, we have a handout
at the back with all of our office
contact information and the names of the
team as I know many of you are just
getting to know us, at least in the
official capacity.
And I wanted to invite you all to my
inauguration which is on January 25th at
300 p.m. We are going to have the
Nickerbacher parade perform and uh we'll
say say a bit more about the vision for
the district and I couldn't be more
excited to serve. I know that the work
that's done in this room and on these
community boards is incredibly important
and neighborhoods work best when
residents are treated as true partners.
Um, I'm here to listen, to learn, and to
begin a working relationship that's
rooted in respect and follow through and
follow up.
[SPEAKER]: Do we have time for questions?
[SPEAKER]: Certainly. Yeah.
[SPEAKER]: Uh, Stu had his hand up first and then I
have
Sorry.
You thought about the importance of
affordability and then you seem to
connect that to education and I wasn't
quite clear what the nexus is if you
could just elaborate on that.
[SPEAKER]: Yeah, I think uh universal child care,
universal prek and prek as extensions of
our education system, those are such
formative years uh for for people for
children. Um, so we know that at 35 is
when a lot of that development is
happening. So having access to high
quality affordable child care before the
public school system kicks in to me is
directly tied to positive outcomes for
children and for education longer term.
Ann I think was next
[SPEAKER]: and then Jerry.
[SPEAKER]: Um so I I want to first thank you. Um
many of our elected officials never send
in
the reports that I assiduously read
before. So I really appreciate that
you're like two weeks in the job and you
already did it. Um, [clears throat] but
I have to say I didn't get a sense and
what I would love to hear for you is
what are your priorities and what do you
like what do you hope to accomplish and
I don't want to make it sound like a job
interview
and a half on that. I love that.
[SPEAKER]: Of course. Uh, I had about a yearong job
interview for for this job. So not not
perturbed by the question. Um, I I grew
up in New York. I think New York is the
best city in the world. Yes. Um, and I'm
very proud of this city. Um, and I want
to fight to keep it that way. In more
recent years, um the trend hasn't hasn't
been at the same standard as the city I
grew up in, and it doesn't feel like the
New York I grew up in where people don't
feel safe on our streets, whether that's
from a wizike when you're just trying to
walk home from the grocery store or uh
shopping in CVS and there's someone who
loots or you you have to call attendant
to get your toothbrush out of CVS jail.
um to being able to practice your
religion and feel safe doing that. Um,
so public safety is a large theme and
I've also seen how our there's a huge
fight on our city with affordability
which we talked a bit about and Harvey
Aldo has emphasized as has our mayor and
it's become so expensive to live in this
city and people, friends, neighbors are
having to move out of the homes that
they've grown up in, the neighborhoods
that they've grown up in or have to move
out of the city altogether and that's
unacceptable for the for the fabric. of
our city, the diversity of our city.
That's what what makes this place so
great. Um, so we can break that issue
down further. There's housing as a large
part of that and I think it needs to be
a big part of the conversation. Um,
increasing housing supply, expanding
programs like screen and dream so that
more people apply for them who are
eligible. I think there's a big
awareness problem. Um, but also those
income thresholds are too low for the
cost of living in the city when you know
your your con Edison bill for a
two-bedroom apartment could be $1,000 a
month. So, um, addressing the um, you
know, those programs and keeping people
in homes when um, we need to be
providing services and not uprooting
families. And then um, dive into the
education, child care part of it. That's
also a very large part of the cost of
living here. Um, and utilities. So, the
council needs to step in and make help
make the city a lot more affordable. Um,
I also care about quality of life. Um, I
think quality of life has a different
definition for a lot of people, but uh,
city council is the closest layer of
government to the people. We're the ones
who will answer the phone as as Harvey
said before when you can't reach the
mayor. So, we're we're the we're
available to um help navigate difficult
civic ch like challenges that you're
having with your government, whether
that's a 311 request that has yet to be
responded to or an application where
it's taking a few months to get a
response and you need it right away. So,
our office is going to be responsive to
those types of issues and constituent
services is the bread and butter of what
a council office does. So over the next
last two weeks I'd say and for the next
couple of weeks making sure our office
is up and running that we've developed
those intergov relationships and are
delivering on constituent services and
addressing any quality of life concerns
that come through our door. And then
lastly I'll add modernizing government
as a as a personal priority of mine. We
are in a situation where state and local
is asked to be producing and doing more
with less where the federal government
is falling short. So you see cities
needing to fill that gap and um I I have
a background in tech and care about
figuring out ways that we can expand the
services that we're offering, increase
access and make it easier to work with
government. Um there an example that
affects wide is uh HPD doesn't have the
technology to detect mold um in in the
same way that the tenants association
has. They've purchased that technology.
It shouldn't be that much of a disparity
between u what the private markets are
offering and how our government is is
operating. So modernizing government. So
I've given you a lot [laughter]
but rule number one in an interview is
keep it tight. So um I'd say
constituents of services and delivering
for people affordability, public safety
and then modernizing technology.
[SPEAKER]: Jerry had a question here.
[clears throat]
[SPEAKER]: Howdy and welcome. It occurs to me that
what I'm going to ask everything is
logistics and to the point please
consider being a notary public after 2
p.m. I know from experience it's all
done by that point. Uh and the last two
um is there consideration of increasing
this uh uh constraint on fake AI ad
beyond the last 90 days? I don't like
the fact that they would still be in the
primaries, but let me back that. Is
there any federal constraint preventing
us from zooming the immigration
interviews? So those are my two
questions.
[SPEAKER]: Ah interesting. So one is on AI
legislation and making
[SPEAKER]: is currently at 90 days. What
[SPEAKER]: I think that with any legislation you
have to start somewhere. So this will be
an ever evolving target much like the
technology which is ever evolving. So
something to keep revising and Zoom is a
great idea for addressing the issues we
were talking about before where you're
afraid to show up for an appointment.
Um, so those are both great ideas to to
bring back. I'll let you know.
[clears throat]
[SPEAKER]: Thanks, J.
[SPEAKER]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER]: Well, you've got your Oops. Is off.
Anyway, you've got your plate pretty
full.
Can I uh ask you to maybe add one more
thing to your agenda? I grew up in New
York City 45 years ago. It was the
greatest city on earth. It was like
little villages to small businesses
everywhere. And what I find is that we
need to bring back mom and pop shops,
small businesses. We're losing all of
these traditional places that you would
go to get your shoes fixed, to get your
your know your your little local artist
or whatever. We've lost I mean I'm old
enough to remember the smell of fish at
the Fton Fish. You weren't born that. U
but you know it made the city what it
was and it was just it was a mixture of
artists and designers and painters and
cobblers and you know it was just a
really marvelous social fabric and I
feel that we're losing it. We're not
really helping small businesses enough.
[SPEAKER]: I agree. Um, and I I add to that empty
storefronts left and right,
[SPEAKER]: left and right.
[SPEAKER]: And I think it's a huge problem uh that
I hope to work on in the council. I
already mentioned that tomorrow we
should get our assignments for u
committees and one of the committees I'm
interested in is economic development
and for small businesses. I used to work
at EDC um city government on on local
economic development and completely
agree with you the city needs to be
doing more to make it first off
affordable to run a small business here.
A lot of the things that we talked about
in this conversation like the con rate
hikes there were over 100,000 if I
remember correctly um small businesses
that are behind already on their
utilities. So, if you're adding more
burden, um it's too expensive to operate
a business here. And I also think this
is where cutting red tape could help
small businesses. Um a lot of laws are
very well-intentioned, but if you're a
small business and you're trying to keep
up with regulations, it can be very
ownorous. Um so, all things that I
definitely want to look at because I do
remember that vibrant city and agree
that's what makes New York so great.
[SPEAKER]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER]: Um we have one more question. Okay.
[SPEAKER]: Hi, Virginia. Um, this is not really a
question. This is just something to put
on your radar. Um, we spoke on Sunday.
Um, so it's related to that. I'm just
going to email you and your staff about
the um the healthc care for the city
retirees. You had a presentation at last
month's and I think the office has been
getting a lot of emails. So, I wanted to
just um email you and have some you or
someone from your office come and also
kind of um give your side of or like
present your position on that. So, yeah,
just I'm going to be emailing your
office. So, just wanted to put that on
your radar. Great. Thank you. Yes. And
we will set a date to come into that
subcommittee and um talk further about
healthcare for the retirees. Uh what I
will say is that I'm relieved that uh
the mayor has said you will not force
retirees to med Medicare advantage or
what I like to call Medicare
disadvantage. Um so I'm I'm glad to see
that. Uh but more should be done to
ensure that people don't lose access to
health care that they were promised. Um,
so I firmly stand with the retirees on
that front that if you're you've been
promised healthcare plan A, you should
not be forced onto a health care plan
that is far far worse, especially when
you're on a fixed income and unable to
afford the shift in cost that will come
with that. So, we can have a a longer
conversation about that in that meeting.
And I owe you a text.
[SPEAKER]: Well, um, thank you very much. That's um
I think that's all the questions we
have.
[SPEAKER]: Okay. Um all right. Next we have Mackie
Bentley from Congressman Nadler's
office.
Mackie.
Okay. We're going to keep on moving
because we're a little behind here. Uh

Cooper's office. I just wanted to wish
people a happy new year and our report
is submitted online if you need to call
our office for any reason and we do
answer the phone too. 21249535.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER]: Great. Thank you very much. Reports are
always um extensive. They're great
exceptional.
[SPEAKER]: Yeah.
Thank you. And now we have Payton
Schultis from Senate um state senator
Gonzalez's office.
said, but happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER]: Luckily, we don't have any questions.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER]: We'll we'll do them online. Um, next we

Bores's office.

[SPEAKER]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER]: All right. Has anyone signed up to speak
in the public session?
[SPEAKER]: They have. Uh, first on the list, we
have Theo Chino, who wishes to speak on
devesting the NYPD funds allocated to UN
security during the general assembly and
having the event organized at the backup
site in Geneva, Switzerland. Uh,
uh, Mr. Chino, you have three minutes to
make your remarks, but only three. You
may begin your remarks now.
[SPEAKER]: Thank you very much. Community board six
um happy new year. Uh I am here today to
begin the process of asking the
community board to pass a resolution
recommending several action related to
UN w
and I'm the national first secretary of
the social democrat of America 501c4
dedicated to teaching socialism. We are
the socialist faction inside the
democratic party. I have submitted my
proposal in writing in which I request
that NYPD diverse resource beyond normal
police activity around the United Nation
headquarter and that there be no street
closure during UN week. As you have
heard, our new mayor has said he will
govern as a democratic socialist. I can
affirm that he is not a socialist.
Otherwise, I would not be here talking
to you in person tonight. I would simply
have it under Mayor Mandani like me is a
leftist but his type of governance is
not socialism. It is closer to meism
associated with the French leader Jean
or the British Jeremy Corbin or the
president of Mexico Claudia Shimmer.
They belong to a broad governance
current of progressive internationalism.
I am not here to beat you apart
[clears throat] from socialism but
understanding this distinction can save
a great deal of time when trying to
understand how [clears throat] different
form of governments operate.
UN week is a nightmare for New Yorker.
The United Nation was built with a
contingency plan. A second general
assembly facility identical in function
to the one here on 42nd street is
located in Geneva and it should not be a
problem for world leader to meet there.
New York City should not be required to
indeed I would then
subsidize the international institution
at the expense of its own resident. For
that reason, I'm asking this community
board to begin a discussion and consider
proposing alternative so that the entire
tri-state area is not negatively
impacted. I send a letter to the board.
I hope they passed it. Global dependency
should not require local disruption
[clears throat] when viable alternative
exist. I am here to answer any question.
Thank you very much for your time and
your
[SPEAKER]: thank you Mr. Chuno. Next on the
speakers list is Fred Tricosh who is a
resident manager at 3303rd Avenue and
wishes to speak on the configuration the
third avenue bike lane by his building.
Mr. Trash, are you here?
I do not see him online, nor do I see
anyone stirring here. Uh, next we'll
move on to
an Surriano, the president of 333rd
Avenue Owners Court, who wishes to speak
on the configuration of the Third Avenue
bike lane near her building. Uh, Miss
Sriano, you have three minutes to make
your remarks. You may begin now.
[SPEAKER]: Okay. Good evening. Uh, thank you for
providing me with the opportunity to
express my concerns about the new
traffic and street organization on Third
Avenue. I am an Serrianiano, president
of the of 3303rd Avenue Owners Corp,
overseeing a 204 unit co-op. Our
residents include families with young
children, professionals, and older
adults, some with ADA, mobility, or
other challenges. I have resided at 330
for almost five decades. Over the years,
this neighborhood has experienced
numerous transformations and face
various challenges.
Ne nevertheless, none of these
developments have resulted in as much
disruption as the current modifications
to our streets and pattern uh traffic
patterns. To be efficient, I'll I'm I'm
putting everything in bullets. Number
one, these are my concerns. When the
number of uh of traffic lanes goes from
four to two, a bottleneck forms across
four at least four blocks. This leads to
persistent honking and other greater air
pollution from idling cars and affects
the peaceful and healthy enjoyment of
our homes. UN events will cause heavier
traffic and more delays than usual. With
the new lane uh new lane arrangements in
front of our building, one designated
for the extended sidewalk, a bike lane
and a third for parking. It is difficult
to hail a cab, get dropped off, unload
groceries, or assist someone in a
wheelchair. This creates a dangerous
situation, particularly for families
with young children, sick individuals,
or those with mobility challenges.
Bicycles now utilize the new bike lane
for travel in both uptown and downtown
directions. This situation poses safety
concerns for residents as it can be
difficult to observe traffic from both
directions simultaneously.
Additionally, it can be observed that
some cyclists do not adhere to traffic
laws such as exceeding uh spots,
failing to stop at at traffic signals,
or leaving the designated bike lanes.
With 204 apartments, we receive many
deliveries multiple times daily from
DHL, UPS, Amazon, Federal Express, and
UPS and USPS,
which creates more problems. Um, moving
trucks used by residents uh to move in
and move out increase traffic and when
and when parking is unavailable, double
parking for these vehicles as well as
the delivery. uh previously mentioned
creates bot</div>
