        <p>the minutes from the September, excuse me, the minutes from the September 10th full board meeting were distributed to board members ahead of time by the board office. If there is no objection, we will adopt the minutes as drafted. Board members, if you object to adopting the minutes, you may raise your hand. Seeing no objections, the minutes from the September 10th full board meeting are adopted. They will soon be available on the CB6 website. chair's report. So, John and I have reached out to our fellow Manhattan community boards regarding the charter charter revision commission's proposals that will appear in November's ballot. And as we heard from our district 2 office, four of our other community boards have expressed interested in co-hosting a forum to help ensure that the public is well informed of the proposals. as we proceed, all boards understand that we must not act in a way that attempts to influence the outcome of the election. That's against the law. We're not allowed to do that. But we do feel that a public forum sponsored by CB6 and other community boards will provide a full and fair opportunity for all concerned to be informed on the importance of these ballot measures. so yes, it's ballot measure 2, three, and four. It's complicated. It's it really needs a very, you know, thoughtful review and we're hoping to do that before election day. So, if you can, this may be the first one that we had, but we may have others. we had a presentation on the upgrades to the 34th Street parking area last night and the improvements that the parks department is making to the space. It's called an interim open space with the understanding that the area needs to be considered holistically as part of the greenway system, but they are installing some improvements to the 34th Street area. and they're doing it very quickly. This is sort of a record-breaking installation. So, it's great. the board office is sending out a notice from the independent budget office which is a nonpartisan city agency that impro improves budget transparency through analyzing budget and policy data. they'll be hosting a webinar on October 20th at 12. I recommend attending. They gave a presentation at Burough Board which was really wellreceived, very informative. and the burough president also has leadership training sessions that are extremely helpful coming up. I think everybody received the notice regarding that their sessions. Okay, good. I see a few nods. It went right over, right? and I understand that the history of some of our long-term issues that the board has been dealing with may be difficult to access. so it's helpful to go back to past meetings. Zoom is our friend in this case. I know you're all looking for something to do late at night, go back and look at those past meetings. and also take a look at the resolutions that have been passed spec and if you have a very specific issue that you would like to know something about, the air table allows you to search very well. And I think we can search our minutes as well using</p>
        <p>we have a minutes database on our homepage. So you there you can find minutes for all the meetings assuming they were submitted and links to the video agenda presentations and then we of course have the reso tracker which hopefully everyone is very familiar with. So, and I know there I mean last last meeting we heard about why isn't our east side waterfront as nice as the west side. And if you go back, you'll see that we've been working on this for a long time. And so, if there's a specific issue, you can kind of check out what our advocacy has been and maybe have some ideas for what else we can do. So,</p>
        <p>All right. And if you do have a very specific issue, you can always ask the chair of the committee or or speak to me about any history that we have. Okay. And our district manager, who I neglected to ask last month if he had a report, said he's going to wave, but I'll let him say that himself. Mercifully, I will wave.</p>
        <p>Okay. And now our treasurer B. Dishman will give Disman will give her report. So mine will be short also in the interest of time. So according to the crystal report received for September in October CB6 is budgeted $627,663 for the fiscal year. However, this includes $145,91 for street fairs and the street fair Maloneyy actually went up this month because we were paid in September $5590. We've already encumbered or liquidated about $259,220 and it leaves us unencumbered Maloneyy of $368,442. I just want to alert everyone we it's very very tight budget last year. As a matter of fact, we had dip into street bear Maloneyy and we don't anticipate that this year will be any different. It is extremely tight. So, we have to be extremely careful in what we're doing. But the budget doesn't give us a lot of leeway. Sandy, if anyone has any questions,</p>
        <p>do any questions for our treasurer? Jason, sorry, just out of curiosity. mostly what is it? What is the implication of dipping into the street fair Maloneyy and why do we not want to do that? Well, we have a resolution from the executive committee that street fair Maloneyy can be used for the benefit of the community board or interest within the community board setting. We have been saving the Maloneyy from the street fair because of the budgets and the tightening of the budgets and the desire to have the staffing that we have. But we had no choice but dipping in because of the different salaries and what we have as staffing. So we have the right by executive committee resolution, but we need to remember once that Maloneyy is gone and the budget is tight, we have no leeway.</p>
        <p>Okay, any other questions?</p>
