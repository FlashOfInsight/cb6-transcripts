        <p>today's my third day, so please be nice. I would love to meet you all and hope to be in person at these meetings as much as possible. So, please grab me, talk to me. this is my third day in the job and my third day in New York. So, really like I want to hear all about I I've been like my mom is from New York, my sister lives in New York. I finally made it home after the military, but I would love to get to know this community through your eyes. So, please talk to me, tell me your experiences. really excited about that. But now, I'm going to get to the announcements. One is assembly member Bores and his wife have happily given birth to a new baby boy Charlie August 16th. Everyone is healthy. They're taking some time obviously, but thank you all for your well wishes there. and then wanted to give an update on the telemarketing bill. So our office passed a bipartisan legislation that nearly doubled the max fine for the do not call list violations. that was in 2023. So, we put together a report to see how that's been doing, how how people have been responding to the new enforcements, and we found that in the decade before the law, there were two fines that exceeded 100,000, but since it took effect, we've already had 10. So, what that means is sending a really clear message that we will enforce those fines if you violate the do not call. So, making sure you guys don't get bothered and if you do that there's the proper consequences. want to let you know we have a shred truck tomorrow morning. We'll be hosting that from our district office. That's at 40th in Lex, but 353 Lexington. That's from 9 till noon. If you guys shrug, please come by if you just want to hang out. Okay. and then also we are offering notary services Monday through Thursday from 10il 2. That's also at district office. other than that, we've got all this should probably be on the form that we sent and I know we'll be answering some more legislative questions on the 23rd meeting or the whatever that meeting is. So, anyway, if you have any questions for me now, I'll stick around. Yes.</p>
        <p>Notary services free or not? Really? They're afraid. You can range wildly. no. We've got someone on our staff who went through the program. Yeah. Please, please come by.</p>
        <p>Okay. Anyone else? Any other questions? Great. Thank you so much. Look forward to working with you. Great. Thank you for coming. So, next we have Spencer from Council District 2. Oh, you're here. Hi.</p>
        <p>Probably this one. good evening everyone. I have just a couple quick announcements. I just want to say that our the the New York City Council District 2 office is still open even though the former council member has departed. We still have staff in the office every day of the week from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. we're checking all the emails, the phones. So, definitely continue to reach out if you need assistance with anything city or council related. I also wanted to flag that there are some upcoming ballot proposals that will appear on the ballot this November. they were drafted by the mayor's charter vision commission and none of them relate to land use and housing. it would take a long time to go into detail about the potential impacts of all these proposals, but I brought some palm cards. I implore everyone to scan the QR code, the website, go through them. If you ever have any questions, feel free to reach out to our office. and yeah, happy to answer any questions. your microphone.</p>
        <p>You you may want to announce that on the 15th there's going to be also a sort of town hall regarding those those questions. Yes, there's also a charter revision</p>
        <p>commission town halls coming up. unfortunately our office can't release communications right now. We're we're kind of limited in what communications we can release. So please check out the pawn cards, check out the website. The website is what's on my ballot.nyc IC that has information on all the Thank you. Any any other questions? No, we're good. Okay. Thanks very much. Okay. All right. Has anyone signed up to speak? They they have</p>
        <p>public session. They have. we have four people signed up. first one, Rebecca Carter from the New York County Defender Services who would like to provide information on a know your rights training that her organization offers. Miss Carter, are you here? I do not see you online. Going once, going twice in the room. All right, then we'll move on. Stephanie Hill, a parent of a student at the UN International School who wishes to speak about issues with homeless individuals near the school. Miss Hill, are you here? I do not see her in the room. All right. Next on the I do not see her online either, but next on the list is Nichollet Ramirez, a resident of Manhattan Community District 6, who wishes to speak about homelessness near East 23rd Street and the FDR Drive as well as the intersection there. Ms. Ramirez, you have three minutes to give your remarks. You may begin your remarks now. Hi, I think I'm speaking also for the parent of Ununice. I'm also a parent of Ununice. So, it's about the traffic situation and the homelessness situation. I'll just read what I prepared. I hope it's 3 minutes. But basically, we need people to take responsibility for the homeless situation. Right now, it's cleared. This past week, somebody took the initiative. I think we've been in touch with Ben Jacobs with Keith P's office. I think the school as well as community members like myself. But basically, we want someone to regularly keep an eye out for people who are not just homeless, but who also need mental health care. U because we've had incidents at the school just a week or two ago, a child was hit in the head with a bottle by a homeless person. Whether they're mentally disturbed or not, we don't know. Also, we need either traffic signs because on the intersection of 23rd and the FDR, there's the bike path by the gas station and there's no sign there for the bikers to slow down. So, the people have the cross sign, but the bikers just keep going. It's also the same with the cars turning the corner there. There's a blind spot, so the people on the north side of 23rd crossing FDR have the cross sign, but the cars coming around have no idea that the people are crossing. I spoke to the person at UNUNICE who's in charge of security. He said if he had to keep track of all the bike, pedestrian, car incidents, he would have a non-stop job 247. So, we need some attention on that area for the homeless, for the mental health, and for the traffic situation. I think that's it.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your remarks. Jason wants to respond. Jason is the chair of our transportation committee. Jason from one in terms about pedestrian safety and bike safety on that intersection 23rd and FDR. we're aware of the situation there. We've been advocating with the DFT to to make some changes and improvements. they've unfortunately been resistant to making any immediate changes given the construction that's going on in that area under the ESCR parallel conveyance project. we'll continue to advocate with them to make those changes as projects I believe ramping up. and we have a meeting tomorrow with the new burough commissioner where intend to bring this up again to to continue to advocate changes there. so we're we're aware of of the situation with traffic there and also trying to to make some improvements.</p>
        <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Thank you. Next on the list is Jorge Vargas, a resident of this district who wish to wishes to speak to the board about traffic safety and homeless encampments. Mr. Vargas, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Thank you. Yes, my name is Far Vargas and I came here in 1977 at the age of seven and I've lived in Simson Town on 20th Street and I remember my first day of school crossing 23rd Street in FDR, the one we're talking about just previously and cars would zoom past 23rd Street off cars come down FDR North and would cheat and light the race down through FDR side streets. Those offcar ramps in the south would also beat the light and speed across. I went to Ununice for many years and I avoided the cars and I saw various accidents personally and heard of others. 48 years later, my six-year-old daughter and I make the same journey home to United Nations schools every day. And as I cross the street and see hundreds of childrens and parents cross that street, I see that this dangerous intersection is even more dangerous. And now, according to New York City data, there's a thousand cars passing there just during 8 and 9:00 a.m. I come here to ask for your help to really push this through because I want to avoid future accidents and I hope I never or anyone else have to come back to report on the death of a young child or a parent. So, simple solutions can really help us. I heard that you guys are talking for the construction. I have not seen construction and in fact, there was a cutting ribbon ceremony probably a couple weeks ago. So hopefully that's done, but this is a very dangerous intersection and I believe that there's many simple solutions we can put in place like you know crosswalk signs, bumps in the road, even when the police are there, cars still avoid and basically pass through intersections. So I do look upon the the various boards here members to please do something. I've know that on January 8th, Matt McCllo came here as a resident of CB6 as well to present the case, the same case for Ununice as well as the British International School. And we need to do something very quickly before something bad happens. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your remarks, Mr. Vargas. That concludes the speakers list for tonight.</p>
        <p>Thank you.</p>
