All right, so first up we have Steve Perez, chair of budget and governmental affairs.</p>
        <p>Thank you Sandy. good evening everyone. So we have a resolution from our committee which is presenting our capital and expense budget requests for fiscal year 2027. Every committee should be familiar with requests they submitted. I do want to point out that this year with the approval of the executive committee, we went through an indepth review of all the requests and went through a process to say that if the requests that were very old and outdated or were not specific enough, we removed them. that was, you know, done in the committee meeting. So, happy to answer any questions. Marty could</p>
        <p>be noted that over the years some things take 20 years to get. So it's quite possible that we're eliminating things that we we've been working on forever. Marty, did you have anything specific</p>
        <p>you wanted to address? No. Okay. Just Okay. It is what it is. All right. Thank you. Alec, I'd like to make a motion to</p>
        <p>reinclude affordable housing funding as part of our capital funding request. I watched the YouTube recording and I agree with a lot of the points that the committee made. and I I think that this issue is just too important for us to not include as a budget request this year. we've included as budget requests in years past. and this city has always responded saying that they support this. and I think that this is something that we should include going forward. So that's second. So I think we have the text</p>
        <p>up for what the proposal was for including affordable housing. if you'd like to take a minute to read that. Can everybody see it? No. Right. I can maybe just summarize the way that</p>
        <p>we read it as committee. it's a very good need statement of the need for affordable housing, but it's not really a budget request. And that's what mystified us about why we're submitting a need state and for we're asking for a capital allocation from HPD. And I don't see how HBD can respond to this in any way that they've ever responded, which is we support it and we will try to accommodate within our resources. So if that's the kind of response we want, happy to submit it again, but I'm not sure what the the goal is of submitting a meeting statement as a budget request when it's not the budget request. cat</p>
        <p>not to get into the weeds but I'm just and I do not with all due respect watch the committee meeting but recognizing that there were some proposals from health and environment a couple others that were from this I totally understand but in your opinion does the budget and governing committee have like a template or a proposal of how to structure a budget request that isn't like as you said a need statement that would be under strong consideration under the dynamics deficit. So we there was some offline discussions</p>
        <p>that happened over the summer with between me and the committee chairs where I was asking questions and giving them ideas about how to make their budget requests more specific. some of I mean obviously some issues are so difficult or perhaps you know the committees didn't meet over the summer so it was not possible to necessarily come up with a great solution for this meeting but now we can't we don't have any more time to sort of and I know that the housing committee is looking at getting all the specific reports and data they need to be able to structure their but we just aren't there yet so I mean every committee has different that it's hard to say there's one formula for different committees who will have very different kinds of robots, but there was a dialogue over the summer about suggestions and ways to the silver housing specifically. It was who was the housing for, what is affordable housing and and where I mean that would be a budget. Marty,</p>
        <p>now that we've decided that after 20</p>
        <p>years of that pit beard, we're weren't going to do anything with it by h by getting rid of the need in the community for affordable housing. We're telling our elected officials that we don't want them to come up with any ideas or any Maloneyy to fill that pit with affordable housing. So, by getting rid of this budget request, we're just saying, "Oh, forget about it. I think we should keep it." Gabe, the other thing I want to point out is that there's a narrative that goes with every goes along with the budget request and the top need for the housing committee is still affordable housing and it has all of the information in there. It's just not a budget request because we don't have anything specific for fiscal year 27. Gabe,</p>
        <p>you stole my rebuttal. That was what I was going to say. We we are quite explicit in the need for affordable housing in the in the statement of district needs. Alec,</p>
        <p>to piggy back off of Marty's point, this is also an endorsement to the city that this is something that we need and it's something that we support. it's not just a budget request. that also can double as the statement of needs and reinforce, especially as we're going to see some new elected officials take office next year, that this is something that we wanted and continue to want going forward. Jim Jim and I've been in I've been in favor for greater specificity in all of these budget requests for as long as I can remember. This particular one should speak to demographics and and the amounts that will be required to f to suit our community district. That said, there's a huge amount of Maloneyy now that was passed in the budget, I guess two years ago, the state budget that was intended for affordable housing. If we stop this matter now, I think officials will say, "Oh, they don't need it. Let's reallocate it to somewhere else." That's my view, just how how somebody would likely interpret it. for that reason, I support the I support the amendment</p>
        <p>and be has her hand raised. Be please go ahead. Thank you. So you you have to look at the responses that come into the capital and what you don't want a response that that we've been getting to this is yes we support it but there's no specificity unless you ask for specificity it's not a budget request it's more of a need statement so I don't support putting something as generalized this that no one could really respond to because we're not giving details or data thank you and I just want to make sure</p>
        <p>everybody is reading the text that was the request which does I think have some spec specificity. So I know we're we're speaking here about this as sort of a very abstract idea but I do think there are some pretty specific details listed in the ask and sorry who else would like to speak Tanya and then we'll we'd like to go ahead and vote. I was part of that very brisk discussion in the budget. If you watched the the film, you would have seen it. I also was one of the ones that wanted to keep it as one of the needs. But I think that this is a call to arms to start really defining what affordable housing is. And I think the problem is that when we throw out something as as broad as affordable housing, we end up with all kinds of poisoned pills being thrown back at us, such as, "Okay, we'll give you affordable housing, but here's a casino." Well, yeah, we'll give you affordable housing, but we're going to take away all Uler or any other form of community involvement because we haven't been specific enough. And I think it it's a call torren for us to be far more specific and be fully educated that affordable housing is not just you know 15% of a building with rentals there. Affordable housing takes on many many different forms and we need to be a little more serious about how we approach it. Daniel and then we'll get back to Mark.</p>
        <p>I guess something that I'm a little confused about and it's probably because I'm new here is like really the drawback of getting the response that says yes, we support this. Thank you for putting it in there. like I I feel like if there's any risk at all of the interpretation that Jim said, then it would be dangerous to not include it. And to the point that, you know, we're opening up a door for like negative repercussions by being too specific. I feel like that's not like that's you can read that and how they respond to it. And if they respond to it by saying that this is, you know, something they're on board with and something that they want to keep pushing and they're not sort of responding it to by saying like they're, you know, all these other externalities, then that's not in there is how I kind of see that. But, you know, I'm new here still and so I don't really know like maybe there is a specific drawback to having that sort of bland response, but I'm struggling to sort of see what it is. Marty, did you want to say something?</p>
        <p>A little background on what the budget requests do. granted, the responses that we get are from the agencies, but the elected officials use the budget, the budget requests for what and where they are going to work. that they may or may not read what is going in our other documentation, but they look through the lines to see what is in the budget request. When we finish here, our chair then will be going to the burrow board in December where the chairs of the 12, community boards of Manhattan will all be presenting to the Manhattan Burough President what in fact they need in their communities. Those issues which are indicated through many of the many of the community boards are the ones that the burrow board then puts on their budget priorities. If we don't want if we don't say that we want something we won't be included in whatever the borrow board then is looking to present Maloneyy for it. So by putting out things that have been there for a while that some other committees, some other community boards then fine is necessary. That's well those are the kinds of things that get funded and again it's the elected officials more so than the specific agencies that will be funding these things. The specific agencies will be doing more in regards to expense budgets because those are items that are 50,000 or maybe 75 now. I mean up to five years worth of use. the electives and then above them the state state electives are the ones will who will be allocating the funds for things like affordable housing. If we don't want it we won't get it.</p>
        <p>just and just in response to that I think if you watched the video I I did advocate that we keep this on the list. one of the things that the Burough president was extremely proud of last year was that every community board listed affordable housing as their number one need. so there is, as as Marty says, there's there's something good about working together across many boards. again, we don't I respect that the committee voted on this, but I I really do think it's important to have this listed. So, Ann had her hand up and then we have Be and Jim and then we'll vote, please. We We've had a pretty robust discussion.</p>
        <p>Yeah. stuck a little bit on the distinction between a district's needs statements and the budget requests and the impact that has on the elected officials because I completely agree with what you said Marty that that the the agencies respond to what the electives want like well they it it is an influence it's an important influence. And so I just but but if we're presenting it as a district need in some ways that to me overrides if we don't have a really specific request hen like isn't it more we're stating a need than stating you know making making a a specific request</p>
        <p>and and I have to say too about things dropping off. Sometimes things drop off because the need is not as strong or the issue has been resolved in other ways. So it's not just that we dropped that. and I might just in response to that so far this is conjecture. We don't really know what the what our elected officials consider more important the district needs or the or the budget requests. maybe I meant to ask one other thing. If if this</p>
        <p>my other question, my actual question is is if this goes on, does something have to come off? No. No. And Jim, and then I'd like to go ahead and vote. I think we've had quite a bit of discussion.</p>
        <p>Sandy, what are we voting on? Are we voting on the And I'm sweepy. We'll let you speak. You had your hand up. Go ahead, Jim. I would just like to to state that I think there's little to no risk of keeping things as they are going the status quo and then next year because none of this is going to be resolved by then next year going ahead and doing a thorough analysis of our housing needs. what percentage of our population is rent burdened, which can be determined from the Department of City Planning website and we can put that up and set it up as a specific budget request and unless somebody else is speaking about that call question.</p>
        <p>B, did you want did you have I had a process question. I assume what</p>
        <p>was just said was an amendment to what we have and therefore you need to vote on the amendment before you vote on the resolution. I was just pointing out the process, right? Yes. So the the vote is to amend the resolution to include affordable housing with the the text that was put on the screen. So point of nation, what happened with the ranking? we're we're proposing to just put it as number one and everything else goes down. There was a discussion at the meeting that the ranking isn't necessarily I let Steve explain that</p>
        <p>I mean each a it depends on who's</p>
        <p>looking at it right if it's an elected official maybe they look at all the rankings but each agency will get only their list so if it's the only if it's only one request for an agency doesn't matter where it is in the prior list so we will have a roll call vote and yes will be in putting affordable housing as handle one at number one. All right. So, as as was mentioned, we</p>
        <p>are now about to conduct a roll call vote to determine whether the resolution on our budget requests will be amended to include as the number one capital request more affordable housing. I will call your name. You will say whether you are in favor or whether you are opposed. If you are in favor, you want the resolution amended to include affordable housing. Number one, capital request. If you are opposed, we want the resolution to stay exactly as it is. Is that clear? Yeah. We'll move on. All right. Tanya Arz</p>
        <p>in favor. Thank you. Kyle Thad,</p>
        <p>I do not think is here. Neil Barkley, in favor. Thank you. Marty Barrett, in favor. Thank you. Elby Barroso, in favor.</p>
        <p>Thank you. Daniel Bernstein in favor. Thank you. Liz Burr in favor. Thank you. Jim Collins. Hi.</p>
        <p>Thank you. Stu Desesser favor. Thank you. B Disman abstain. we didn't give you that as an option. On a procedural matter.</p>
        <p>On a procedural matter has to be one or the other. So nay. Nay. Okay. Maya Donahghue is not here. Robert Farfan</p>
        <p>has not arrived. Barack Freriedman in favor. Okay. Jason Fromitz Okay. Eric Goldberg did not arrive yet. Okay. Justin Goldberg.</p>
        <p>All right. Gloria Hage. Thank you. Ravia in favor. Okay, thank you. Paige Judge in favor. Okay. Lupal Kakad is not here. John</p>
        <p>Keller in favor. Okay. Kate Kennedy. Okay. Katie Lando in favor. Okay. Thank you. Sandre Liftoff</p>
        <p>in favor. Okay, Anton Melner is not here. Sandy McKe in favor. Thank you. Alec Militec in favor. Thank you. Rich Mintz</p>
        <p>in favor. Thank you. Kevin O'Keefe in favor. Thank you. Rashma Patel in favor. Thank you. Steven Perez.</p>
        <p>Okay. Will Perry in favor. Thank you. Omar Keshi in favor. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Marryiam Ralph in favor. Thank you. Michael Anroe is not here. Larry Shy in favor. Thank you. An Seligman</p>
        <p>in favor. Thank you. Sandro Sherrod is not here. I think Wuin Sadiki in favor. Thank you. Alleti Simon is not here. Mark Thompson</p>
        <p>in favor. Thank you, Gabe Tzo. In favor. Thank you, Cat Valero. In favor. Thank you.</p>
        <p>James Vera, in favor. Thank you, Jerry Weinstein. In favor. Thank you, Sarah Whittington. Opposed.</p>
        <p>Thank you. David Woods in favor. Thank you. up. All right. 33 people voting in favor which leaves six voting opposed. This is added to the resolution. So now the resolution will indicate that public that more affordable housing is the number one capital request for this board and all the other capital requests will just shift down one spot. So now we can vote on the final</p>
        <p>resolution if there unless there are any other issues that people would like to discuss. Okay, please go ahead and mark your ballot. And Steve, did you have a report you wanted to just to remind all the committees to we have to submit our updated need statements also with the budget request. So if you would like to make any changes to your need statement, please do so before the end of the month so that our office can submit the report. Thank you. And yes, please take a look at that because there's some really outdated information. We talk about the pandemic. It's passed.</p>
        <p>The 1918 pandemic.</p>
        <p>Spanish flu. Yeah. okay. So, next we have business affairs and licensing and Seligman, vice chair, is going to lead the discussion. Back here. Yeah. So yeah we have seven eight items on the agenda. Are there eight resolutions? Are there does anybody have any questions? Any suggestions perhaps to bundle?</p>
        <p>I think I think we can bundle I think it's appropriate to bundle the ones that are DOT issues and ones that are the state liquor authority if we can do those into kind of two trenches. Does that make sense to everyone? Yeah. Yes. So which ones are DOT? So the first A B C and D.</p>
        <p>A B C and D. Yeah. Okay. makes in the bundle. Yeah. ABC second. Okay. So, please go ahead and mark your digital ballots for A, B, C, and D. All right. And we're</p>
        <p>and the the last four are all pretty, you know, pretty straightforward, not controversial. SLA alterations or a couple of new locations. so any questions or issues with any of those? Okay, seeing none, motion. Yeah, I move.</p>
        <p>Okay, please go ahead and vote on E through H and and do you have a report? No, since I am not the chair, I will wait the chair's report. Okay, thank you. moving on to land</p>
        <p>use and waterfront. Gabe Tzo, chair. Thank you. Okay. We have a resolution to augment and make permanent installations of new pedestrian amenity amenities including seating and planters at 599 Lexington Avenue. That's the plaza at 53rd with a 6B and M meet. It's it's lovely and I urge you to support it. Any questions? Okay. seeing no further questions, we will vote on 3A. Please go ahead and mark your ballot.</p>
        <p>Do you have a report? Yes, I do. So, I'm sad to say I lied to Brock last month. I said that the the pinch point would be done by the end of the decade. DDC came to us saying it would be done in Q3 of 2030. So, we were close but not quite. We're going to have a presentation next month from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Maybe we're working on it to talk about the water supplies and aquaer health. we are going to continue to the discussion on the faith-based affordable housing with answers to the questions raised last month provided perhaps in writing from Senator Gonzalez offices or potentially we might have somebody from Assembly Member Bores's office like communicating with them. and that's it. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Okay. transportation Jason from chair. Thank you. so we have a resolution tonight on quest for a truckload lighting zone in front of 509 Thirdrd Avenue. It's at the corner of 34th Street and Third Avenue. we had a presentation from the management company andor owner of the space. and they the space is currently vacant. They're retail space. they are attempting to they desire to lease the space to a grocery store. they have a fairly large basement space as a part of the space that they're looking at and they think that'd be appropriate for a grocery store. they they have they in their presentation to us they shared that they were having difficulty leasing the space given the absence of a loading zone and that they feel they would be able to more likely secure space for a grocery store secure a tenant for a grocery store if they had a loading zone in place. so we ultimately reached the conclusion that we felt it'd be appropriate to write a resolution, pass a resolution in favor of a loading zone being established in front of that storefront on the condition that the space is leased to a grocery store. a couple other notes on the space right now. So it's about the length of a maybe two cars tops. currently, that space is a no parking or no standing. No standing, I believe. no stand no standing from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. So the truck loading zone would apply in the evening hours. So the the 7:00 p.m. to 7 a.m. in in those two spaces would be the become a truckloading zone. Also important to note that it wouldn't be exclusive to to to the landlord or to that store. it would be a truckloading zone that that could theoretically be utilized by by anyone although it would in fact be in front of that store room. and again happy to take any question.</p>
        <p>Tanya was first here. Jason, can they specifically say that there's a specific couple of supermarkets that have decided not to lease it because of the loading zone or is this just theoretical? They they they didn't really want to commit to like naming anyone and they did, but basically they were saying that they've in touch with a lot of different tenants and that that's a prevailing concern from the grocery store tenants that there's no loading zone and it makes them hesitant to consider locating there. so I I think that's we reached a reasonable compromise in supporting this under the condition that they're able to find at the grocery store. also I should have added that some the resolution makes the case that a grocery store is valuable to the community, provides access to fresh food and jobs, and that we believe it'd be valuable to have a grocery store in that space.</p>
        <p>All right. Thank you. And then cat. conditional on the grocery store but regardless was it discussed at the meeting and apologies I didn't watch the recording about adaptation because that is a big corner lot if there's trash or recycling when you're talking about loading just looking at the the grocery store a couple blocks down the street Trader Joe's is a great example there's just a lot of coming and going of using this in in favor. I think being a really good mechanism whether the next tenant whoever it is was that discussed because that's a very high populated traffic oriented area whether it's 7:00 p.m. to 7 a.m. It's also a high-rise residence area. So I'm just curious was that discussed at any night?</p>
        <p>it wasn't. I I think it's sort of out of the scope of our purview as transportation committee. but yeah, I appreciate the concern, but yeah, not something that that we discussed during the committee. So, okay, if there's no more discussion, let's vote on resolution 4A.</p>
        <p>And while you were voting, I have a brief report. I attended DT's meeting with the Margel Neighborhood Association on 34th Streetway. thanks for DT for putting that together. they did a nice job of responding and addressing concerns that were raised there. and on a similar note, DT has announced that they either have or will be starting implementation of the 31st Street busway. they expect that to be completed before the end of the fall. and they have also shared that they plan to begin installation of the bike lane on 30 I'm sorry third third Avenue the protected bike on third Avenue starting this month and ending this fall.</p>
        <p>Great. Yeah. what's what do you mean by the end of the fall? Like by de November December? Yeah. I'm not exactly sure. I don't think I can be specific.</p>
        <p>Okay. all right. Next. Park, landmarks, and cultural prayers. Neil Barkley. Kevin. Oh, I'm sorry, Kevin. They did. They did come out with a statement today that said December they expect it to be ended. Hello.</p>
        <p>Good evening. Okay. Do we have one resolution this evening? [Music] All right. This is for it's a resolution regarding certificate of appropriateness for LPC 257749 for exterior signage at 126 128 East 36 Street LPC being landmark preservation commission and everyone had a vote right question or it's okay okay please go ahead and mark your ballot week</p>
        <p>and you can now hit submit once you have voted. Okay. let's see. We discussed the park that will be placed where the former NYU parking lot was. Sandy already gave pretty good description of that. Rafia, she returned to the committee. She had a baby and so she attended the baby also attended. So you love babies. All the good news we can get.</p>
        <p>I know. And then one thing I would just say I'm pretty much unfinished, but was Steve with the email that Steve sent out over the summer. It was very detailed. it pointed out a lot of things that you know we didn't even think about with different issues in the parks and budget requests. So I just wanted to recognize your work. Well, sorry, Jim has a question for you. Yes. I've noticed that Stson Park, which is supposed to be open from 6:00 a.m. on, is very often not open at 6:00 a.m. The gates are still closed. Just wanted to bring that to your attention. I'm usually up at 5:00 a.m. and walk by there between 6:00 and 6:30.</p>
        <p>Okay. We can we can certainly let parks know because on the other side we're hearing that it's not closed, but now it's not open. So maybe sometime Yeah, that's what some of the complaints are. But yeah, we can certainly ask the parks department about that.</p>
        <p>okay, next we have health and environment. Gloria Hay is vice chair. Hello. A quick war to help Ruple. So Sandy Ruple H6 and I to Belleview with Karen Moore the chair of the Belg cab and Sage Robinson the public affairs department head on September 12th. So Rupa will give more detailed about what happened in that meeting, but overall swag was really quite amazing. Swag from the meeting.</p>
        <p>Swag swag. the the commitment, the expertise, the innovative health care and the dedication to serving all including our community, the greater New York City community and heads of state was incredibly impressive. I had no idea that they were the hospital for the general assembly, but they are and they have treated heads of state. So, also just a couple things. They have 90 specialty clinics and they are the only level one trauma center and level two pediatric trauma center south of 68th Street. So, working with them and supporting them and their ability to best serve our community is an important priority. Tomorrow night, great meeting. Come We will be and we've heard about it today. The beheard we're going to have a presentation by a representative from the mayor's office on the be her heard program which is the behavioral health emergency assistance response division. And the program was launched in 2021. Aims to have EMTs, paramedics from the New York City Fire Department and mental health professionals from the New York City Health and Hospitals respond to 911 mental health calls instead of the NYPD. And the program's aim is to treat mental health emergencies as a health emergency and not a public safety emergency. So, we're going to get hear a lot about what's been going on with that. Also, tomorrow we have a discussion about CRAM. K R A T O M which was brought to our attention by a concerned member of the community. It's a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia and it has been used as herbal medicine for you know historically but it in high doses it's addictive and basically it's sold in stores in our community without any warnings about possible addiction and as of now is legal in New York state but New York state legislation currently has 10 bills related to it so we're going to be talking about that as well. Thank you. Great.</p>
        <p>That was too long. Any questions? All right, let's move on to housing and homelessness. Alec Milit. so we are not meeting this month</p>
        <p>because we know scheduled meeting with Dewali. So we will be meeting in November. last month I sort of informally pulled community committee members for topics and issues that we'd like to discuss this fall regularly. So some of the issues that we we show a lot of interest in include homelessness housing policy. We're going to get some speakers to come and and speak to the committee. trying to make a homeless organization come in November and maybe even some housing policy organizations come in December, January. So, stay tuned. Thanks.</p>
        <p>Hey, question. Oh, question. I'm sorry, Brock. Hey, so we have a Midtown South reszoning like Fifth Avenue to 8th Avenue. Well, it doesn't really include our area. We have quite a bit of office buildings and some of them could be converted. I think just the first office buildings now being converted into housing and like 120 studios or something like that. have you taken up the issue of zoning and conversion? we we haven't. That's more of a land use committee issue, but as as I'm sure everybody's aware, housing and land use kind of go hand in hand. So, I think this is probably something that maybe we can talk about in the future. And actually we do as part of the ULERP we have a a study being done by city planning and that's one of the issues of you know how do we directly get affordable housing in our district and looking at spaces that they've asked us to propose spaces that could be utilized</p>
        <p>but I also don't think the geography of</p>
        <p>that resoning includes any portion of our community. No I do not. Thank you. Okay. youth and education Katie Katie Lando. We haven't the youth and education</p>
        <p>committee as yet this year. Our first meeting is going to be this month on the 28th and we'll be talking about the the issues that we want to deal with this year. Any questions for you? Okay. public safety and sanitation, Stu Desert. Oh, I'm sorry, Jim. I saw a statistic. This scared me to death. is that it said that the one of the national educational outfits that assess the statistics said that in New York City fourth graders only 19% were reading at grade level. 19%. That may be something you may want to look into. I I'll dig up the article and send it to you if you want us through the office. But please, it's I don't know if they need to get up on it or what, but it's horrible. You can't go teach a kid.</p>
        <p>Yeah. If you can't read. Yeah. Yeah. I know there there's a the schools have had been asked to implement a new leaving teaching program and I did talk to one principal about it who said she asked the the teachers to have the students on their desk but not to use it because she feels it's so bad. So I think there are real problems with that. But thank you. I'd like to see that. Okay, Steu, we're going to be talking about some legislation proposed in Albany that would expand the court court's opportunity to send people who are arrested to treatment as opposed to Rikers. The premise basically being that if somebody's in distress when they go into Rikers, they're not going to come out of treatment tends to reduce recidivism. so we're looking about legislation and surroundation.</p>
