        <p>The minutes from the December 10th full board meeting were distributed to board members ahead of time by the board office. there is one modification that vice chair Sarah Whittington gave the report for the parks, landmarks, and cultural affairs committee. If there is no objection, we will adopt the minutes with that modification. Board members, if you object to adopting the minutes, you may raise your hand. Seeing no objections, the minutes for the December, excuse me, 10th full board meeting are adopted. They soon will be available on the CB6 website. chair's report. we have a new member. We want to welcome Samir Anador. He's starting this evening. Samir, do you want to stand up? And actually, any anyone who is coming to the event on January the 23rd will get to meet him in a in a better atmosphere. Samir's already said that he's coming</p>
        <p>and he's bringing his wife, which is Yeah, that's why I'm New York. Actually, my wife's doing her PhD at NYU. So, yeah, good to meet everyone.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I must say that's very brave. Sometimes people [laughter] don't want to bring their spouse. right off the bat. Right off the bat, but look forward to Exactly. more about the the so in the new year we're continuing to work on several initiatives.</p>
        <p>how do reimagine our waterfront? We're exploring housing opportunities with the department of city planning. which was one of the requirements of the ULRP that just passed. not just passed, but we're working with our fellow Manhattan community boards to document the existing housing stock and our housing needs. And the Spark project, which Council Member Maloneyy mentioned, is actually starting deconstruction. And it's actually really interesting because they're going to use as much of the material of the existing building as they can for the new building and the new the new site. So, it's a new program. so, Oh, yes. the Can we show that?</p>
        <p>Yes. Here's the invitation to the town hall. It's actually the same night as our executive committee, but</p>
        <p>also up here. Yeah. And we'll also be working with our council member to for the task force as it continues to move forward. Yeah. And there are hard copies in the back for anyone who wants copies.</p>
        <p>Right. And so each of our committees has some homework. we've asked each committee to document the district needs as they pertain to that committee and it's not an easy task but I think all the committees will be up for it. I know the health health committee has health and education committee has started. They had their first meeting about this. and we're also preparing handbooks for new members that will provide them with the information they need to quickly become familiar with the work and the history of each committee. And so that's something we're looking to comm community committee members to participate in. And we're getting together on January 23rd, five tutor city to celebrate the new year. please bring your favorite dish and or beverage and we are taking donations. Cash is best is what we've decided, [laughter] but I think we'll work out any other ways that people want to donate Maloneyy to.</p>
        <p>What are the donations for? beverage and food. So, but I mean if if you're a great cook and you want to cook, that's fine, too. And then you don't need to donate. It's really</p>
        <p>How and when do the donations go? We're giving our donations to our secretary, our treasure. Sorry, [laughter] our new treasure. I just found out because she deals with Maloneyy and I don't know. so, and we'll we'll sort out some different ways to do that. Okay.</p>
        <p>But All right. and it's it's also it's a good opportunity to meet people on the board and as we'll get to meet our new member as well. so our district manager, Jesus Perez, will now give a report. Happy new year, everyone. I'm glad to see you here. I'll keep it very, very brief. since you heard earlier that community board applications are about to be released. remember that we do have a resource on our website that will be helpful for you if you don't remember whether you have to reapply this year or not. In the resources for CB6 members section of our website, just go to resources and pick resources for CB6 members. We have a membership status resource that will allow you to see a list of whether you're applying this year or reapplying next year. And since term limits are almost upon us, we also have a list for when your term limit is. We keep very good records at CB6. So the lists are correct. and so if you need that information, you have it there.</p>
        <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Okay. Our treasurer, Tanya Aras, will now give a report. Okay. First and foremost, I can't possibly pretend to fill in Bee's shoes. And B, thank you so much for everything. I know I I can't live up to you, but I'm going to make an effort to not embarrass you. How's that? Okay. According to the Crystal Report for January 5th, 2026, CB6 is budgeted $627,663 and 0 for the fiscal year. This includes street fair Maloneyy of $145,901.
