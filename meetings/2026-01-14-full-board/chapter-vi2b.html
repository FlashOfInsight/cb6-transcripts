        <p><span class="transcript-time">1:31:18</span> pedestrian space and we're I think everybody on the committee is all for that. just want to say these streets were chosen because they've been designated as protected bike lanes by the Department of Transportation. You go on Google Maps or the city bike map, these are protected bike lanes, but in reality, they're not. you know, cyclists will just go and then be veering into traffic because they're constantly blocked. So, we're just saying, listen, if you're going to designate them as protected, they should be protected. Great.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:31:49</span> All right. If if there's no</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:31:50</span> objection, we'll [clears throat] please mark your digital ballot.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:31:54</span> I have a couple things I want to talk</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:31:55</span> about. first off, I just want to acknowledge there was a serious cycle of injury, an accident on 57, the second day. and I think that's just important this context of everything we're talking about today and as we work to try to make our roadways safer and improve the design of our streets. and thoughts out to that injured cyclist. I want to address some things that were brought up on the third Avenue bike lane. first of all, we do plan to discuss the concerns raised around entry and exit from the garage of that building in our March transportation committee meeting. But I wanted to just sort of respond broadly about Third Avenue bike lane. CBD 6 has advocated for several years to ask for a bike lane and expand the pedestrian space and the bus lane on Third Avenue. this has been something that we've been very publicly advocating for for a very long time. I know personally I'm very excited to see the project having finally come to fruition in. and as a somebody who's walked and cycled on on the corridor, I think it's made a big improvement on on safety and and accessibility. we know from extensive data on protective bike lanes in Manhattan that they work to improve safety, improve safety for cyclists, improve safety for vehicles and pedestrians. we know that reactive bike lanes work great on First Avenue and Second Avenue within our district. and there's no reason why Third Avenue won't be a long-term success as is all of the other protected bike lanes in our community. And they grow close to growing majority of bike lanes in Manhattan North streets. and lastly, effectively this bike lane provides equity to the use of third avenue. Previously, we had five avenues, sorry, five lanes of traffic on Third Avenue, but an extensive amount of pedestrian traffic, legless traffic, and trans riders and buses on Third Avenue. And so this new configuration, is really just creating equity. Instead of having five lanes dedicated to just vehicles, we now have a much more equitable split of the use of the roadway. but again, we will be discussing their concerns about the the garage on on safety concerns. be with them in our merch [clears throat] game. and lastly, I just wanted to acknowledge last week we had a very exciting anniversary, the one-y year anniversary of Justin Rising.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:34:18</span> I was just going to ask you,</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:34:21</span> there was a there was a great New York</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:34:22</span> Times article that I wanted to call attention to a couple of the points from it. where they were evaluating how the program has gone over the last year. and basically the data points to basically success on virtually all metrics. So, encourage everybody to take a look at the New York Times article, not just take my word for it, but they specifically called out that there are, on a daily basis 73,000 fewer vehicles entering the central business district each day, which is really substantial number. traffic is 4.5% faster within the zone and 2.2% faster in the area surrounding the zone. If you'll recall, that was a big push back around congestion that it was going to cause traffic getting into the zone, around the zone. that has not come to fruition. there have been 300,000 more people riding the subway each day. vehicle noise complaints are down on 31 17% within the congestion [clears throat] congestion zone. people seriously injured in vehicle collisions down 8.6%. The only thing that the Times article brings as inconclusive or potentially negative is that air quality improvements. there hasn't been a the data is a bit inconclusive on the benefits. so I think everyone should take a look at the article but I think they did a great job of summarizing how the brother's gone and I think exciting to see when you're in [clears throat]</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:35:46</span> Daniel go ahead. It's funny, I was just</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:35:49</span> going to ask you about that because living in Midtown sometimes it doesn't feel like it has done much about the traffic, but I find that bike lanes are highly respected. You know, you don't see cars parked there. There's they're not blocking it. However, the bus lanes continue to be blocked.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:36:07</span> Yeah. And it is an absolute nightmare</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:36:10</span> trying to get up and downtown with the bus lanes all blocked many times by actual police cars.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:36:19</span> Yeah.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:36:20</span> You know, so it is I [clears throat]</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:36:22</span> find that bike lanes are always free. No problem. But bus lanes are a problem. What are we going to do about that, Jason? [laughter]</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:36:32</span> I I'll confess the narrative that the</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:36:34</span> bike lanes are always clear. things are actually fairly frequently blocked and and cyclist have to access the bike lanes to be able to divert the roadway. but I definitely agree that there's a similar problem on the bus way bus lanes. I think solution like bus ways where we have the the roadway fully dedicated to buses. Those are one way in which we solve that problem. We have the resolution asking for that on 31st Street and 42nd Street. we supported it for Teen Street's bus way which I think is great. Obviously you can't do that everywhere.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:08</span> You can't do it on the on the avenues.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:10</span> Yeah. I think some of the things</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:13</span> that we have also done and supported is having offset bus lanes. So when you don't have the bus lane right at the curb</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:19</span> that helps to alleviate some of</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:21</span> that. We're also seeing double bus lanes in some areas city. of Madison Avenue. We recently passed a resolution I think in the spring where we'll have two bus lanes on the west side of Madison Avenue north 42nd Street I believe.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:40</span> I think it's on the west side of the</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:42</span> north at 34.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:44</span> It doesn't matter.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:47</span> So, I think there's a number of u different ways that we attack that problem, but I agree it's something that we need to keep seeing.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:56</span> I like the idea of having space, you</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:37:58</span> know, like the bus lane one space over.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">1:38:01</span> yeah, and we recently saw that</p>
