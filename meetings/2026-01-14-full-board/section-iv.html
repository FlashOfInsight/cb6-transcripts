      <div id="transcript" class="content-panel">
        <p>charter charges the the executive department. you're supposed to provide information when we have to for it. the reality isn't quite so pretty. we have been asked on several occasions to departments even though we're a city agency. so my first question is how can your office help us get these agencies to Kruegerate? And secondly, many departments no longer like to pay overtime. We meet in the evening. Many of the people in those departments with whom you want to speak only work during the day. So they will not make them available to us. So how can we address that? Well, on the first question about our council member Harvey Epsteinin is here. I'd love to work with the council member on perhaps a legislative response to making certain that community boards get the information they need and don't have to resort to foil. That said, please view my office working in conjunction with council member Epstein as leverage to get that information as quickly as possible. I know that Marielle and Broa would be really responsive to a community for request in that regard as would I. So, let's work in conjunction to get you [clears throat] the information you need and let's look at a legislative potential solution as well. [laughter]</p>
        <p>Yeah, already. That's right. But in terms of requiring you to foil, maybe we need clarification. Okay, we're good at asking us. [laughter]</p>
        <p>Marty has a question. as I've asked your predecessors for the last 35 years. The board after a few months when the initial new members come in, starts losing members by the end of the term we're generally down 10. And I've asked your predecessors since you [clears throat] had this dugout full of people who really want to come on the board [clears throat] to while there's a an a opening during the year to get somebody on so that the committees don't have to work with much fewer [clears throat] people than we really need.</p>
        <p>Marty, we have a new member this evening. Okay.</p>
        <p>That was just assigned to the board. But I I completely agree that we have to make quorum. Let's start with that. And if it's hard to make quum because members aren't being replaced and I think it also goes to the initial appointment process that we make sure we appoint community members who are committed to it and understand what they're getting into. so there's a couple of ways to approach that, but certainly being responsive to vacancies I think is really important. I take it seriously. I was a community board member for a decade. I chair for three years. so I like</p>
        <p>I know and I hear on that. So let's make certain that we are responsive to that. Thank you. Great. Hope any other questions. Well, I'm sure we'll think of something. Thank you. See you soon. Thank you. Next we have our new council member Harvey.</p>
        <p>Want me over there? You want me whatever you like being over here. So I'm gonna come over here. Your hometown. Want to thank our president Bradle. I know his presence is going to be missed in Albany. We'll be very very lucky to have our president. Thank you. But you went to Aldi yesterday. I didn't go. And just so you know that, you know,</p>
        <p>community boards, I think you should be really feel comfortable reaching out to his office. It's going to be an ally. We need to get replacements for our seats. I know Brad's committed to that. He and I both served on community boards very long time. Both former chairs of board, so we know how important community boards are. And if you do have to figure out this a legislative fix, it might just be trying to get it directly from the mayor's office and we try to push that as well. So there way we can figure that out together. Happy to. so I want to introduce [clears throat] Ben. Is this your first meeting?</p>
        <p>Not yet. Second meeting. Okay. I want to introduce Ben from my team who's going to be our community board six lon. Ben is great. He really cares about this community, cares for these issues. Reach out to him in our newsletter. Everyone's email. it's in the back page of newsletter. I think there's they're on the back page. Yeah. So, if you need your questions, we're all there. Everyone's email. So, you can reach out to all of us. So, you have questions. Want to talk about things that are going on in the last month. It feels like you know when I was in the assembly I came in doesn't feel that much different but I'll just so I know earlier in the week we had a rally trying to con I don't know if people saw the con has proposed you know increases again this year in addition to the 25% increase they've got in the last 5 years we had over 110 elected officials sign on to this letter that we we sent to the public service commission they're voting later this month we're encouraging the mayor to oppose this increase, you know, the idea that, you know, people who are struggling right now are struggling. And my new colleague Virginia Maloneyy walked in the door. [laughter]</p>
        <p>He started rocking today. Virginia. so you know, Virginia and I were were at this kind of press conference and we're really hopeful that the mayor along with other elected officials can convince the governor and the public service commission to oppose the increase and review all we can do. Really appreciate that. also I don't know if you heard earlier this week staffer of the city council was by ICE who was at a press conference earlier in the week with the speaker Julie Menon and yesterday we had a press conference again with the the staff of the the council. it rang just that someone who's here legally, you know, has working papers, works for the city council, went for an appointment and was detained even though they have a job. They have connections here. It's really just another outrageous what's happening with ICE happened the other day on Seventh Street just you know 10 minutes from here. Someone's just picked up at their place and employment. So what I doing not just in New York but obviously around the country is really really despicable and it's you know I think we it's really incumbent upon us to stand up and speak out on these issues.</p>
        <p>Yeah. and we you know our inauguration launch great things youth council you can read it if you want in the newsletter. yeah, had some fun times because we got multist, you know, if you haven't lost your tree yet, you still want to do it, I encourage you to do that. there's we spent a little time talking about you the last couple weeks because you know what the new mayor said is things we talked about this be her program deal with me pressures and where these holes are and I think it's really important to try to figure out how to fix those holes in the system. I know Senator Gonzalez and I have been talking a lot about this. So, there's there's some really important legislative fixes. If you [clears throat] pay attention to tomorrow, there'll be some announcements on the city council, by the way, where all the new members, all the committee assignments, chair assignments, all this stuff. So, that's going to go public tomorrow. And if you have questions, you know, please ask or please ask Ben, my office. We want to make sure we continue to be available for this community. And if the chair allows, I'll take a question,</p>
        <p>please. Well, we've got three. Tanya, do you want to go first? Hi, Harvey. It's so great to see you.</p>
        <p>what is the justification? What are they trying to explain as the increase, the double digits increase on utilities? Because oil is at $60 a barrel. I mean, it's it's not like we're going through an oil crisis. Is this the AI centers that's pushing this? What is it? You know, it's interesting because we haven't seen spikes in usage in New York City, you know, and honestly 70% of outside New York City connectors are to 9.4% profits. So like if they're getting their shareholders 9.4% profits of 150,000 New Yorkers last year the utility shut off in the balance. I'd rather get less profits and make sure people keep their utilities on. You know 500,000 New Yorkers are behind. It's just to me what we said is just really a Maloneyy grab by KED and I think we need to stop them in their tracks. We talked a lot about affordability. you know, it's rent and utilities and that's what affordability is about and I, you know, kind of shouldn't be able to get away with this.</p>
        <p>How can we stop? Well, we testify, we've written letters, you encourage the mayor to support us. I think that would be really helpful. The board wants to pass resolutions and their exec committee. You know, it's really important to kind of fight this increase and to stop the service commission from allowing this to happen.</p>
        <p>Thank you. Ann and then Brook you had a question too. You can just since you mentioned Bernard a couple of months ago we did pass a resolution in support of it and expanding it but the earlier mayoral administration had frozen it like no funding no expansion. Are you saying that the new administration is working on expanding and how are they going to fund it? like any do you have any other details? Yeah, we talked to the mayor about this and he's deeply committed to doing it and moving towards a beard model and creating a new 911 system which you know allows people who need adult professionals to get those people who need social workers or the domestic violence situation and people who need police because of violence can get different people to come out. So, it's really restructuring 911. I've talked to the may personally about it. is very excited about doing it. I don't know the time frame to do it, but my expectations in in this year's budget, I think it'll be a commitment from all of us.</p>
        <p>Great. Ann has has a question. yeah, to just to follow up on Tanya's question also, I mean, I don't even buy I have to buy buy energy distributed by K, [clears throat] but I do not buy their energy, right? Right. I use an ask and still they are like 60% of the expense. It's it's crazy. So I wonder if there are opportunities for restructuring of that as well. And I did not know about the commitment to their shareholders. I feel like damn I saw you. You know we worked hard as you know in a</p>
        <p>different hat when I was in worked hard in trying to restructure kind of and the public service commission and it was really really hard to do because I entrenched interest on the city level. We really have little oversight over kind so we can do [clears throat] what we can but it you know and I think it's is hard to do and kind basically has a monopoly right which is why we should be able to regulate them as a higher standard than you know somebody that is operating in a theoretically and that's what the public service</p>
        <p>commission was set up to do to regulate them and as the understand increases.</p>
        <p>My other question was actually about the city council staffer that was detained still detained. Still detained. He's originally from Venezuela. He was steered legally. He, you know, worked and said he was [clears throat] showing up for a regular appointment. He's still detained. And the message coming out of the Trump administration is horrific. Never no criminal history, no nothing. And they're just saying we're keeping him. is dangerous. Don't show up for an appointment. Right. That's the message. If you show</p>
        <p>up going actually to 26 photo tomorrow with a constituent who's got a 9:00 a.m. appointment, they have they're in a tough spot. They either show up and potentially get picked up or they don't show up and then they risk getting picked up. There's no winning. So, I'm going to go with them tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. because at least I can put my body in front of theirs. Awful. Cert has a question up here too. You can have it. [laughter]</p>
        <p>First of all, congratulations. And switching gears a little bit. The mayor and the governor together this week have press conference or earlier what we call child early childhood education. And I was wondering whether any mechanisms [clears throat] for implementing that in its early days have been identified and also wondering whether there's room you know for a community board to play. I know Dan Garney and Ben Kalos are so active in getting seats for [clears throat] this the district you know years ago. Is there any role that the community board could play in that?</p>
        <p>I I think people know that you know 3K and 3K is pretty up and running in our neighborhood. So, it's really expanded to it'll be the two case seats that we're going to look to expand and whatever the board can do to help support council member Maloneyy, myself, Senator Gonzalez, you know, we'll have an assembly member soon, not yet, but you will and force to make sure that you know communities [clears throat] across the city get heard. It's going to be the state budget to be on how much Maloneyy we have and then we figure that out how we're going to allocate it on the city side. But I'm optimistic.</p>
        <p>[clears throat] All right, we have two more questions. Maya would had her hand up and then and then I had a question about what the city's looking at as far as so we've been asking about if the city docks are upgrading them to be electrified so they can get recharged at the station around. so in relation to the company trying to increase the price of energy how that relates to they're trying to electrify this become in this more yeah I mean electrification and</p>
        <p>increased energy cost you know some really difficult thing because we need more power because we're using more electricity we're moving to more EV vehicles we got to put more charging infrastructure in place we're also going to need that path to plan ahead they increase their capac capacity. Obviously, we had some browns over the summer again this year. So, it's a capacity issue that and I try to name the client interview to hear about, but they know this is our commitment and they're the ones responsible putting, you know, charging infrastructure in the city. That's there's given them that authority. So, they know that they need to increase capacity and increase load. [clears throat]</p>
        <p>Rashman, I think is our our last question. I can hold up your It's a great water bottle. Everyone that Oh, and hand sanitizer. [laughter] To ask what John said this week, just I</p>
        <p>think it was yesterday, a couple of friends called me. They were trying to get their children into KC and they called me because they're like, "How do we get in touch with the mayor's office?" Apparently, there's a kiosk where there's a QR code, sign up, we have funding, but then when they go to the website, the website's not working, and then you're on hold for a couple of hours when you try to call. Okay. So, I told them to reach out to their council member, and you were actually in Virginia district. So, I put [laughter] them in, but I just want to bring that up.</p>
        <p>Yeah, that's good. Virginia on the spot when she But yeah, that's if they have problems</p>
        <p>with that, then we should be hearing it. We can talk to you know they all we have governmental contacts in the mayor's office. We can be reaching out to them directly to talk about the addition easier to get in touch with the council rather than the mayor's office. Sure it's a little but true right you guys sponsor sponsor exactly on the</p>
        <p>grounds. Thank you all for letting me take so much your time and I hope everyone has a good January and I'll see you all soon. Thank you for coming. And now we have council member Virginia Maloneyy. Thank you. I'm glad we had Barbie go before me and all the tough questions. I'm in the clear. But I'm Virginia Maloneyy and I'm really grateful to be here as your council person to represent District 4. I'm a lifelong Manhattanite and grew up on the east side of Manhattan and I'm just very excited. So thank you for having me here for my first community board meeting as officially an elected official. Congratulations. I'm very lucky to get to work with such great colleagues like former assembly member, now council member Barbie and we as mentioned have already hit the ground running partnering on things that matter to this community which where we share border including the coned press conference earlier this week or was it last it was last week this week Monday. So all the already bl together.</p>
        <p>Yeah. So thank you again Harvey for</p>
        <p>organizing that and for being here tonight. I also want to take a moment to recognize my predecessor Keith Powers who was my council member for eight years and we can give him [clears throat] a round of applause. I'd like to add that he consistently showed up for community board 6 and his offer delivered real long-term results. everything from tenants protection and affordability advocacy to cutting through red tape with agencies when issues stall. Many of you got to work with him directly and that kind of follow through matters and being available and accountable matters. So I'm going to continue in that tradition of public service over the next four years and I'm grateful to call him a friend and a confidant. We also had a surprise visit in our new office this week in Dan Robnik who came by to pick up some artwork and share some stage advice to to our team. so we've had phenomenal examples of public servants that have represented this district and I hope to meet that same bar. we kind of heard a bit about what's been going on in the council, but it's not been a slow two weeks. I'm on day 14 on the job. but we already stood up to rising utility rates. I was at the state of the state yesterday where I heard from the governor about her priorities and how those will impact the city. everything from affordability, which we all know is really top of mind for New Yorkers, to AI policy that she's planning to roll out at the state level to protect protect people and also be just be more transparent when AI is being used particularly in the case of political ads. let's see. We had a briefing from the Spark Life Sciences to learn more about that project and I know you all will be invited to attend the briefing on the 21st. and we've had two tenants association meetings. So, both with Stason Peter Grouper Village, and I was in this room just last night at this same time talking to the Wateride tenants. so it's been a busy busy few weeks, two weeks. but we are just getting started. The most important update is that our office is open. So, I want you all to know that we are keeping Keith Powers's office for the near term. So, you'll know where to find us if you've been there before. And it's the same building, right?</p>
        <p>Yes. Yeah. I'm on the 12th floor. so it still says keep powers on the door, but we're working we're working on changing that. But, I will be there and I want to take a minute to introduce our team. So, Isabella, hi everyone. My name is Isabella Sano. I'll be working in constituent services and in community affairs for the office. I'm an east side resident. I'm also an attorney, soon to be public. so we're going to invite you into our office for any of your notary public needs. So, moving forward, either I will be here or a member of my team will be at community board meetings. some other familiar faces. Shelby Garner is the chief of staff. Bree Pair is going to be doing community affairs. And Anna Barrett who was on my campaign team is doing comms for legislation and budget. Sophie Sakor who works with worked with Alex Gores's office has joined our team. So we've got an all-star group. we're hiring for constituent services. but we are up and running. you can email us at district4selic.gov which is the same email that you could reach that and the phone number is the same. So, we're just just a slight difference, a different person there. But, I'm really thrilled that Keith will hopefully continue to serve in Albany and we'll continue to have a really strong partner and advocate for the district. In that, we have a handout at the back with all of our office contact information and the names of the team as I know many of you are just getting to know us, at least in the official capacity. And I wanted to invite you all to my inauguration which is on January 25th at 300 p.m. We are going to have the Nickerbacher parade perform and we'll say say a bit more about the vision for the district and I couldn't be more excited to serve. I know that the work that's done in this room and on these community boards is incredibly important and neighborhoods work best when residents are treated as true partners. I'm here to listen, to learn, and to begin a working relationship that's rooted in respect and follow through and follow up.</p>
        <p>Do we have time for questions? Certainly. Yeah. Stu had his hand up first and then I have Sorry. You thought about the importance of affordability and then you seem to connect that to education and I wasn't quite clear what the nexus is if you could just elaborate on that. Yeah, I think universal child care, universal prek and prek as extensions of our education system, those are such formative years for for people for children. so we know that at 35 is when a lot of that development is happening. So having access to high quality affordable child care before the public school system kicks in to me is directly tied to positive outcomes for children and for education longer term. Ann I think was next</p>
        <p>and then Jerry. so I I want to first thank you. many of our elected officials never send in the reports that I assiduously read before. So I really appreciate that you're like two weeks in the job and you already did it. [clears throat] but I have to say I didn't get a sense and what I would love to hear for you is what are your priorities and what do you like what do you hope to accomplish and I don't want to make it sound like a job interview and a half on that. I love that. Of course. I had about a yearong job</p>
        <p>interview for for this job. So not not perturbed by the question. I I grew up in New York. I think New York is the best city in the world. Yes. and I'm very proud of this city. and I want to fight to keep it that way. In more recent years, the trend hasn't hasn't been at the same standard as the city I grew up in, and it doesn't feel like the New York I grew up in where people don't feel safe on our streets, whether that's from a wizike when you're just trying to walk home from the grocery store or shopping in CVS and there's someone who loots or you you have to call attendant to get your toothbrush out of CVS jail. to being able to practice your religion and feel safe doing that. so public safety is a large theme and I've also seen how our there's a huge fight on our city with affordability which we talked a bit about and Harvey Aldo has emphasized as has our mayor and it's become so expensive to live in this city and people, friends, neighbors are having to move out of the homes that they've grown up in, the neighborhoods that they've grown up in or have to move out of the city altogether and that's unacceptable for the for the fabric. of our city, the diversity of our city. That's what what makes this place so great. so we can break that issue down further. There's housing as a large part of that and I think it needs to be a big part of the conversation. increasing housing supply, expanding programs like screen and dream so that more people apply for them who are eligible. I think there's a big awareness problem. but also those income thresholds are too low for the cost of living in the city when you know your your con Edison bill for a two-bedroom apartment could be $1,000 a month. So, addressing the you know, those programs and keeping people in homes when we need to be providing services and not uprooting families. And then dive into the education, child care part of it. That's also a very large part of the cost of living here. and utilities. So, the council needs to step in and make help make the city a lot more affordable. I also care about quality of life. I think quality of life has a different definition for a lot of people, but city council is the closest layer of government to the people. We're the ones who will answer the phone as as Harvey said before when you can't reach the mayor. So, we're we're the we're available to help navigate difficult civic ch like challenges that you're having with your government, whether that's a 311 request that has yet to be responded to or an application where it's taking a few months to get a response and you need it right away. So, our office is going to be responsive to those types of issues and constituent services is the bread and butter of what a council office does. So over the next last two weeks I'd say and for the next couple of weeks making sure our office is up and running that we've developed those intergov relationships and are delivering on constituent services and addressing any quality of life concerns that come through our door. And then lastly I'll add modernizing government as a as a personal priority of mine. We are in a situation where state and local is asked to be producing and doing more with less where the federal government is falling short. So you see cities needing to fill that gap and I I have a background in tech and care about figuring out ways that we can expand the services that we're offering, increase access and make it easier to work with government. there an example that affects wide is HPD doesn't have the technology to detect mold in in the same way that the tenants association has. They've purchased that technology. It shouldn't be that much of a disparity between u what the private markets are offering and how our government is is operating. So modernizing government. So I've given you a lot [laughter] but rule number one in an interview is keep it tight. So I'd say constituents of services and delivering for people affordability, public safety and then modernizing technology.</p>
        <p>Jerry had a question here.</p>
        <p>[clears throat] Howdy and welcome. It occurs to me that what I'm going to ask everything is logistics and to the point please consider being a notary public after 2 p.m. I know from experience it's all done by that point. and the last two is there consideration of increasing this constraint on fake AI ad beyond the last 90 days? I don't like the fact that they would still be in the primaries, but let me back that. Is there any federal constraint preventing us from zooming the immigration interviews? So those are my two questions.</p>
        <p>interesting. So one is on AI legislation and making is currently at 90 days. What</p>
        <p>I think that with any legislation you have to start somewhere. So this will be an ever evolving target much like the technology which is ever evolving. So something to keep revising and Zoom is a great idea for addressing the issues we were talking about before where you're afraid to show up for an appointment. so those are both great ideas to to bring back. I'll let you know. [clears throat] Thanks, J. Yeah. Well, you've got your Oops. Is off. Anyway, you've got your plate pretty full. Can I ask you to maybe add one more thing to your agenda? I grew up in New York City 45 years ago. It was the greatest city on earth. It was like little villages to small businesses everywhere. And what I find is that we need to bring back mom and pop shops, small businesses. We're losing all of these traditional places that you would go to get your shoes fixed, to get your your know your your little local artist or whatever. We've lost I mean I'm old enough to remember the smell of fish at the Fton Fish. You weren't born that. U but you know it made the city what it was and it was just it was a mixture of artists and designers and painters and cobblers and you know it was just a really marvelous social fabric and I feel that we're losing it. We're not really helping small businesses enough.</p>
        <p>I agree. and I I add to that empty storefronts left and right, left and right. And I think it's a huge problem that I hope to work on in the council. I already mentioned that tomorrow we should get our assignments for u committees and one of the committees I'm interested in is economic development and for small businesses. I used to work at EDC city government on on local economic development and completely agree with you the city needs to be doing more to make it first off affordable to run a small business here. A lot of the things that we talked about in this conversation like the con rate hikes there were over 100,000 if I remember correctly small businesses that are behind already on their utilities. So, if you're adding more burden, it's too expensive to operate a business here. And I also think this is where cutting red tape could help small businesses. a lot of laws are very well-intentioned, but if you're a small business and you're trying to keep up with regulations, it can be very ownorous. so, all things that I definitely want to look at because I do remember that vibrant city and agree that's what makes New York so great.</p>
        <p>Thank you.</p>
        <p>we have one more question. Okay. Hi, Virginia. this is not really a question. This is just something to put on your radar. we spoke on Sunday. so it's related to that. I'm just going to email you and your staff about the the healthc care for the city retirees. You had a presentation at last month's and I think the office has been getting a lot of emails. So, I wanted to just email you and have some you or someone from your office come and also kind of give your side of or like present your position on that. So, yeah, just I'm going to be emailing your office. So, just wanted to put that on your radar. Great. Thank you. Yes. And we will set a date to come into that subcommittee and talk further about healthcare for the retirees. what I will say is that I'm relieved that the mayor has said you will not force retirees to med Medicare advantage or what I like to call Medicare disadvantage. so I'm I'm glad to see that. but more should be done to ensure that people don't lose access to health care that they were promised. so I firmly stand with the retirees on that front that if you're you've been promised healthcare plan A, you should not be forced onto a health care plan that is far far worse, especially when you're on a fixed income and unable to afford the shift in cost that will come with that. So, we can have a a longer conversation about that in that meeting. And I owe you a text.</p>
        <p>Well, thank you very much. That's I think that's all the questions we have. Okay. all right. Next we have Mackie</p>
        <p>Bentley from Congressman Nadler's office. Mackie. Okay. We're going to keep on moving because we're a little behind here. Wendy Brennan from State Senator Krueger's office.

Thank you very much. Reports are always extensive. They're great exceptional. Yeah. Thank you. And now we have Payton Schultis from Senate state senator Gonzalez's office. said, but happy to take any questions.</p>

        <p>[laughter] We'll we'll do them online. next we have Julie Roland from Assembly Member Bores's office. [clears throat] Hey, hello everyone. I'm Julie Roland from Alex Bores's office.

        <p>have Theo Chino, who wishes to speak on devesting the NYPD funds allocated to UN security during the general assembly and having the event organized at the backup site in Geneva, Switzerland. Mr. Chino, you have three minutes to make your remarks, but only three. You may begin your remarks now. Thank you very much. Community board six happy new year. I am here today to begin the process of asking the community board to pass a resolution recommending several action related to UN w and I'm the national first secretary of the social democrat of America 501c4 dedicated to teaching socialism. We are the socialist faction inside the democratic party. I have submitted my proposal in writing in which I request that NYPD diverse resource beyond normal police activity around the United Nation headquarter and that there be no street closure during UN week. As you have heard, our new mayor has said he will govern as a democratic socialist. I can affirm that he is not a socialist. Otherwise, I would not be here talking to you in person tonight. I would simply have it under Mayor Mamdani like me is a leftist but his type of governance is not socialism. It is closer to meism associated with the French leader Jean or the British Jeremy Corbin or the president of Mexico Claudia Shimmer. They belong to a broad governance current of progressive internationalism. I am not here to beat you apart [clears throat] from socialism but understanding this distinction can save a great deal of time when trying to understand how [clears throat] different form of governments operate. UN week is a nightmare for New Yorker. The United Nation was built with a contingency plan. A second general assembly facility identical in function to the one here on 42nd street is located in Geneva and it should not be a problem for world leader to meet there. New York City should not be required to indeed I would then subsidize the international institution at the expense of its own resident. For that reason, I'm asking this community board to begin a discussion and consider proposing alternative so that the entire tri-state area is not negatively impacted. I send a letter to the board. I hope they passed it. Global dependency should not require local disruption [clears throat] when viable alternative exist. I am here to answer any question. Thank you very much for your time and your</p>
        <p>thank you Mr. Chuno. Next on the speakers list is Fred Tricosh who is a resident manager at 3303rd Avenue and wishes to speak on the configuration the third avenue bike lane by his building. Mr. Trash, are you here? I do not see him online, nor do I see anyone stirring here. next we'll move on to an Surriano, the president of 333rd Avenue Owners Court, who wishes to speak on the configuration of the Third Avenue bike lane near her building. Miss Sriano, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now.</p>
        <p>Okay. Good evening. thank you for</p>
        <p>providing me with the opportunity to express my concerns about the new traffic and street organization on Third Avenue. I am an Serrianiano, president of the of 3303rd Avenue Owners Corp, overseeing a 204 unit co-op. Our residents include families with young children, professionals, and older adults, some with ADA, mobility, or other challenges. I have resided at 330 for almost five decades. Over the years, this neighborhood has experienced numerous transformations and face various challenges. Ne nevertheless, none of these developments have resulted in as much disruption as the current modifications to our streets and pattern traffic patterns. To be efficient, I'll I'm I'm putting everything in bullets. Number one, these are my concerns. When the number of of traffic lanes goes from four to two, a bottleneck forms across four at least four blocks. This leads to persistent honking and other greater air pollution from idling cars and affects the peaceful and healthy enjoyment of our homes. UN events will cause heavier traffic and more delays than usual. With the new lane new lane arrangements in front of our building, one designated for the extended sidewalk, a bike lane and a third for parking. It is difficult to hail a cab, get dropped off, unload groceries, or assist someone in a wheelchair. This creates a dangerous situation, particularly for families with young children, sick individuals, or those with mobility challenges. Bicycles now utilize the new bike lane for travel in both uptown and downtown directions. This situation poses safety concerns for residents as it can be difficult to observe traffic from both directions simultaneously. Additionally, it can be observed that some cyclists do not adhere to traffic laws such as exceeding spots, failing to stop at at traffic signals, or leaving the designated bike lanes. With 204 apartments, we receive many deliveries multiple times daily from DHL, UPS, Amazon, Federal Express, and UPS and USPS, which creates more problems. moving trucks used by residents to move in and move out increase traffic and when and when parking is unavailable, double parking for these vehicles as well as the delivery. previously mentioned creates bottlenecks by narrowing lane lanes even further to one lane. Due to the new street configuration and post office trucks parking in front of our building, we lose most of our parking spaces. The post office trucks also park in front of fire hydrants, which is a safety sat hazard for our residents, making it difficult for emergency vehicles to access our building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riano, your time has elapsed. Okay. All right. Thank you very much for your remarks. the next person on the list is Alan Cyrunk. is Alan Cyrunk here? doesn't appear. So, next person on the list is Leonardo. you didn't give your last name, so you can give it to us when you get up here. wishes to speak to the board about urban mobility and herb intelligence. You will have three minutes to make your remarks. You will begin your remarks now, but please give your last name for the record. I represent this project.</p>
        <p>[clears throat] We have created a intelligence layer so we understand how legal and efficiently move in the city. Our core AI understand signs or the parking rules and let you know before you park or after you park what the rules are, when they will change and how this affect New Yorkers is that in 2025 there was 1 million dollars in tickets or parking tickets and violations. Our software helps the city move faster by helping the users understand and eliminate the uncertainty of when the rule is going to change and also alerts you when you are already part and this helps the community to understand better how to move legally and efficiently and also we have a a layer that lets you share your departure time. So nearby drivers can see when you are about to departure and they can arrive. So this facilitates the location of or filing of a legal spot and that's what our mission and we would like to link and collaborate with city officials in order to help users understand how AI can help them understand policy and rules. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
        <p>Thank you very much for those remarks. That concludes the speakers list for this evening. Okay.</p>
