        <p><span class="transcript-time">32:46</span> Maya would had her hand up and then and then</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">32:48</span> I had a question about what the</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">32:50</span> city's looking at as far as so we've been asking about if the city docks are upgrading them to be electrified so they can get recharged at the station around. so in relation to the company trying to increase the price of energy how that relates to they're trying to electrify this become in this more</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">33:11</span> yeah I mean electrification and</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">33:13</span> increased energy cost you know some really difficult thing because we need more power because we're using more electricity we're moving to more EV vehicles we got to put more charging infrastructure in place we're also going to need that path to plan ahead they increase their capac capacity. Obviously, we had some browns over the summer again this year. So, it's a capacity issue that and I try to name the client interview to hear about, but they know this is our commitment and they're the ones responsible putting, you know, charging infrastructure in the city. That's there's given them that authority. So, they know that they need to increase capacity and increase load. [clears throat]</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">33:55</span> Rashman, I think is our our last</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">33:57</span> question. I can hold up your It's a great water bottle. Everyone that</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:12</span> Oh, and hand sanitizer.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:14</span> [laughter]</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:16</span> To ask what John said this week, just I</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:19</span> think it was yesterday, a couple of friends called me. They were trying to get their children into KC and they called me because they're like, "How do we get in touch with the mayor's office?" Apparently, there's a kiosk where there's a QR code, sign up, we have funding, but then when they go to the website, the website's not working, and then you're on hold for a couple of hours when you try to call. Okay.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:38</span> So, I told them to reach out to their</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:40</span> council member, and you were actually in Virginia district. So, I put [laughter] them in, but I just want to bring that up.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:45</span> Yeah, that's good. Virginia on the spot</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:47</span> when she</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:50</span> But yeah, that's if they have problems</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">34:52</span> with that, then we should be hearing it. We can talk to you know they all we have governmental contacts in the mayor's office. We can be reaching out to them directly to talk about the</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:00</span> addition easier to get in touch with the</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:03</span> council rather than the mayor's office.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:06</span> Sure it's a little but true</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:09</span> right</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:10</span> you guys sponsor sponsor exactly on the</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:13</span> grounds. Thank you all for letting me take so much your time and I hope everyone has a good January and I'll see you all soon. Thank you for coming.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:24</span> And now we have council member Virginia</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:26</span> Maloneyy.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:34</span> Thank you. I'm glad we had Barbie go</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">35:37</span> before me and all the tough questions. I'm in the clear. But I'm Virginia Maloneyy and I'm really grateful to be here as your council person to represent District 4. I'm a lifelong Manhattanite and grew up on the east side of Manhattan and I'm just very excited. So thank you for having me here for my first community board meeting as officially an elected official. Congratulations. I'm very lucky to get to work with such great colleagues like former assembly member, now council member Barbie and we as mentioned have already hit the ground running partnering on things that matter to this community which where we share border including the coned press conference earlier this week or was it last it was last week this week Monday. So all the already bl together.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">36:33</span> Yeah. So thank you again Harvey for</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">36:36</span> organizing that and for being here tonight. I also want to take a moment to recognize my predecessor Keith Powers who was my council member for eight years and we can give him [clears throat] a round of applause. I'd like to add that he consistently showed up for community board 6 and his offer delivered real long-term results. everything from tenants protection and affordability advocacy to cutting through red tape with agencies when issues stall. Many of you got to work with him directly and that kind of follow through matters and being available and accountable matters. So I'm going to continue in that tradition of public service over the next four years and I'm grateful to call him a friend and a confidant. We also had a surprise visit in our new office this week in Dan Robnik who came by to pick up some artwork and share some stage advice to to our team. so we've had phenomenal examples of public servants that have represented this district and I hope to meet that same bar. we kind of heard a bit about what's been going on in the council, but it's not been a slow two weeks. I'm on day 14 on the job. but we already stood up to rising utility rates. I was at the state of the state yesterday where I heard from the governor about her priorities and how those will impact the city. everything from affordability, which we all know is really top of mind for New Yorkers, to AI policy that she's planning to roll out at the state level to protect protect people and also be just be more transparent when AI is being used particularly in the case of political ads. let's see. We had a briefing from the Spark Life Sciences to learn more about that project and I know you all will be invited to attend the briefing on the 21st. and we've had two tenants association meetings. So, both with Stason Peter Grouper Village, and I was in this room just last night at this same time talking to the Wateride tenants. so it's been a busy busy few weeks, two weeks. but we are just getting started. The most important update is that our office is open. So, I want you all to know that we are keeping Keith Powers's office for the near term. So, you'll know where to find us if you've been there before. And it's the same building, right?</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">39:18</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">39:22</span> Yeah. I'm on the 12th floor. so it</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">39:25</span> still says keep powers on the door, but we're working we're working on changing that. But, I will be there and I want to take a minute to introduce our team. So, Isabella,</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">39:39</span> hi everyone. My name is Isabella Sano.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">39:42</span> I'll be working in constituent services and in community affairs for the office. I'm an east side resident. I'm also an attorney, soon to be public. so we're going to invite you into our office for any of your notary public needs. So, moving forward, either I will be here or a member of my team will be at community board meetings. some other familiar faces. Shelby Garner is the chief of staff. Bree Pair is going to be doing community affairs. And Anna Barrett who was on my campaign team is doing comms for legislation and budget. Sophie Sakor who works with worked with Alex Gores's office has joined our team. So we've got an all-star group. we're hiring for constituent services. but we are up and running. you can email us at district4selic.gov which is the same email that you could reach that and the phone number is the same. So, we're just just a slight difference, a different person there. But, I'm really thrilled that Keith will hopefully continue to serve in Albany and we'll continue to have a really strong partner and advocate for the district. In that, we have a handout at the back with all of our office contact information and the names of the team as I know many of you are just getting to know us, at least in the official capacity. And I wanted to invite you all to my inauguration which is on January 25th at 300 p.m. We are going to have the Nickerbacher parade perform and we'll say say a bit more about the vision for the district and I couldn't be more excited to serve. I know that the work that's done in this room and on these community boards is incredibly important and neighborhoods work best when residents are treated as true partners. I'm here to listen, to learn, and to begin a working relationship that's rooted in respect and follow through and follow up.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">41:57</span> Do we have time for questions?</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">41:59</span> Certainly. Yeah.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">42:00</span> Stu had his hand up first and then I</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">42:02</span> have Sorry. You thought about the importance of affordability and then you seem to connect that to education and I wasn't quite clear what the nexus is if you could just elaborate on that.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">42:17</span> Yeah, I think universal child care,</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">42:21</span> universal prek and prek as extensions of our education system, those are such formative years for for people for children. so we know that at 35 is when a lot of that development is happening. So having access to high quality affordable child care before the public school system kicks in to me is directly tied to positive outcomes for children and for education longer term. Ann I think was next</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">42:57</span> and then Jerry.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">43:00</span> so I I want to first thank you.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">43:05</span> many of our elected officials never send in the reports that I assiduously read before. So I really appreciate that you're like two weeks in the job and you already did it. [clears throat] but I have to say I didn't get a sense and what I would love to hear for you is what are your priorities and what do you like what do you hope to accomplish and I don't want to make it sound like a job interview and a half on that. I love that.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">43:40</span> Of course. I had about a yearong job</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">43:43</span> interview for for this job. So not not perturbed by the question. I I grew up in New York. I think New York is the best city in the world. Yes. and I'm very proud of this city. and I want to fight to keep it that way. In more recent years, the trend hasn't hasn't been at the same standard as the city I grew up in, and it doesn't feel like the New York I grew up in where people don't feel safe on our streets, whether that's from a wizike when you're just trying to walk home from the grocery store or shopping in CVS and there's someone who loots or you you have to call attendant to get your toothbrush out of CVS jail. to being able to practice your religion and feel safe doing that. so public safety is a large theme and I've also seen how our there's a huge fight on our city with affordability which we talked a bit about and Harvey Aldo has emphasized as has our mayor and it's become so expensive to live in this city and people, friends, neighbors are having to move out of the homes that they've grown up in, the neighborhoods that they've grown up in or have to move out of the city altogether and that's unacceptable for the for the fabric. of our city, the diversity of our city. That's what what makes this place so great. so we can break that issue down further. There's housing as a large part of that and I think it needs to be a big part of the conversation. increasing housing supply, expanding programs like screen and dream so that more people apply for them who are eligible. I think there's a big awareness problem. but also those income thresholds are too low for the cost of living in the city when you know your your con Edison bill for a two-bedroom apartment could be $1,000 a month. So, addressing the you know, those programs and keeping people in homes when we need to be providing services and not uprooting families. And then dive into the education, child care part of it. That's also a very large part of the cost of living here. and utilities. So, the council needs to step in and make help make the city a lot more affordable. I also care about quality of life. I think quality of life has a different definition for a lot of people, but city council is the closest layer of government to the people. We're the ones who will answer the phone as as Harvey said before when you can't reach the mayor. So, we're we're the we're available to help navigate difficult civic ch like challenges that you're having with your government, whether that's a 311 request that has yet to be responded to or an application where it's taking a few months to get a response and you need it right away. So, our office is going to be responsive to those types of issues and constituent services is the bread and butter of what a council office does. So over the next last two weeks I'd say and for the next couple of weeks making sure our office is up and running that we've developed those intergov relationships and are delivering on constituent services and addressing any quality of life concerns that come through our door. And then lastly I'll add modernizing government as a as a personal priority of mine. We are in a situation where state and local is asked to be producing and doing more with less where the federal government is falling short. So you see cities needing to fill that gap and I I have a background in tech and care about figuring out ways that we can expand the services that we're offering, increase access and make it easier to work with government. there an example that affects wide is HPD doesn't have the technology to detect mold in in the same way that the tenants association has. They've purchased that technology. It shouldn't be that much of a disparity between u what the private markets are offering and how our government is is operating. So modernizing government. So I've given you a lot [laughter] but rule number one in an interview is keep it tight. So I'd say constituents of services and delivering for people affordability, public safety and then modernizing technology.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">48:21</span> Jerry had a question here.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">48:23</span> [clears throat]</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">48:23</span> Howdy and welcome. It occurs to me that</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">48:27</span> what I'm going to ask everything is logistics and to the point please consider being a notary public after 2 p.m. I know from experience it's all done by that point. and the last two is there consideration of increasing this constraint on fake AI ad beyond the last 90 days? I don't like the fact that they would still be in the primaries, but let me back that. Is there any federal constraint preventing us from zooming the immigration interviews? So those are my two questions.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:03</span> Ah interesting. So one is on AI</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:06</span> legislation and making</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:08</span> is currently at 90 days. What</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:11</span> I think that with any legislation you</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:13</span> have to start somewhere. So this will be an ever evolving target much like the technology which is ever evolving. So something to keep revising and Zoom is a great idea for addressing the issues we were talking about before where you're afraid to show up for an appointment. so those are both great ideas to to bring back. I'll let you know. [clears throat]</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:39</span> Thanks, J.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:40</span> Yeah.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:41</span> Well, you've got your Oops. Is off.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">49:45</span> Anyway, you've got your plate pretty full. Can I ask you to maybe add one more thing to your agenda? I grew up in New York City 45 years ago. It was the greatest city on earth. It was like little villages to small businesses everywhere. And what I find is that we need to bring back mom and pop shops, small businesses. We're losing all of these traditional places that you would go to get your shoes fixed, to get your your know your your little local artist or whatever. We've lost I mean I'm old enough to remember the smell of fish at the Fton Fish. You weren't born that. U but you know it made the city what it was and it was just it was a mixture of artists and designers and painters and cobblers and you know it was just a really marvelous social fabric and I feel that we're losing it. We're not really helping small businesses enough.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">50:52</span> I agree. and I I add to that empty</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">50:56</span> storefronts left and right,</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">50:58</span> left and right.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">50:59</span> And I think it's a huge problem that</p>
<p><span class="transcript-time">51:03</span> I hope to work on in the council. I already mentioned that tomorrow we should get our assignments for u committees and one of the committees I'm interested in is economic development and for small businesses. I used to work at EDC city government on on local economic development and completely agree with you the city needs to be doing more to make it first off affordable to run a small business here. A lot of the things that we talked about in this conversation like the con rate hikes there were over 100,000 if I remember correctly small businesses that are behind already on their utilities. So, if you're adding more burden, it's too expensive to operate a business here. And I also think this is where cutting red tape could help small businesses. a lot of laws are very well-intentioned, but if you're a small business and you're trying to keep up with regulations, it can be very ownorous. so, all things that I definitely want to look at because I do remember that vibrant city and agree that's what makes New York so great.</p>
