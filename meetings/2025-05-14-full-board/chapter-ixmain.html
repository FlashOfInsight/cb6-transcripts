Our elected officials sent in their reports ahead of time and they are compiled on the CB6 website. The link to the reports was sent out ahead of time and for your convenience can be found in the chat on Zoom or by going through our websit's page for full board meetings. I will now call in each of the elected officials who have RSVPd so that they can take questions from CB6 members and the public from their presubmitted reports. Each elected official will be able to field questions. If there are no questions, we will move to the next elected official on our list. If an elected official has a time-sensitive matter to report on that they didn't make into their presubmitted support, they will have three minutes to do so. During this part of the meeting, we'll also hear, excuse me, from government agency representatives who have requested to address the board tonight. First on our list, we have Alex Garcia from District Attorney Brad's office. Alex. he has his hand raised. You, Alex, you should be able to speak now. Why is my camera not on? I'm having some camera issues. I'm not sure why. I can promote you to a panelist and you should be able to have your camera on. Okay. Yeah, I kind of need to. thank you so much for that. Sorry, I don't hope to delay anything or anyone. I do have some announcements to make. So, I'm going on behalf of the Manhattan days office. I'll get through those as quickly as possible. So it our offices announced the indictment of an individual for making terrorist threats against a central synagogue and the Jewish community on February 13th through 14th, 2025. The individual reportedly posted threats on excluding a pan a plan to attack Shabbat services and identifying as the reincarnation of Hitler threatening further violence against Jewish people. He was arrested and route to Manhattan. our office. to quote director district attorney Brag directly, nobody should have to fear their safety when they are in a house of worship and the language really allegedly used by the defendant is extremely disturbing. My office will remain vigilant against any and all threats to the Jewish community and I hope our prosecutors and law enforcement partners for this work on this matter. next, our office would like to announce the indictment of an individual for allegedly sexually assaulting six women in his Midtown apartment between 2024 and March 2025. The 116count indictment includes charges of predatory sexual assault, rape, facilitating a sex offense with a controlled substance, assault, bribing a witness, and weapons related charges. The individual allegedly raped and violently assaulted the women, threatening them, and used his position as an attorney to intimidate them. to quote Alvin Bragg, "This investigation is ongoing. We have a reason to believe there may be additional survivors. Our talented prosecutors and investigators as well as our specially trained counselors are here to support you, no matter how powerful the person who assaulted you seem to be. Please call special victim submission hotlines and I will also put it in the chat. It is 212 3353400. Thank you." And lastly, our office would actually announce the sentencing of Midtown postal workers Destiny Anderson and her partner Anthony Johnson for the credit cards and checks from the mail. Anderson received three years of conditional discharge while Johnson faced one and a half to three years in prison. they both worked at the postal office at Rockefeller building. That is it. Thank you. Okay. good news and bad news. seconds. Do we have do we have any questions for Alex? Seeing none, thank you very much. We'll move on to Braa Rosenberg. Braa, are you Yes. Sorry, can you come back to I'm having a technical difficulties on my end, but I should resolve them in the next few minutes. Absolutely. Joanna Sanchez from Assembly Member Epsteinin's office. You got you got someone different. Oh, okay. Harvey Epsteinin from Harvey Epsteinin. Epstein is I don't want to take Joanna's thunder, but I'm happy to talk. You're welcome. I just wanted to hope everyone's doing well. Happy miday. just wanted to give folks, you know, we had a really late budget this year. We just passed it last Thursday. Just wanted to give a quick update. It's in our report, but so there's a lot of things in there for the $254 billion budget. A lot of great stuff on housing we put in about supporting existing middle- inome housing. Mitchell Llamas, reducing the tax rate for Mitchell Lamas. A lot of Maloneyy that we did for environmental issues. The bell to bail ban on cell phones in schools as a controversial issue that we were able to pass to make sure all public schools now are not going to have kids have phones during the school day. There's a bunch of things on on discovery changes as well as a mask issue. I don't know if the governor really pushed for a mask change and we did a minor mass change to to make mass potentially a crime in addition to some other violation. But overall the budget was a healthy budget and really lived up to our values on the housing environment, you know, education. We put a lot of Maloneyy into our schools, public safety, more supportive housing units, really switching away our existing 911 system to try to create a new system, the mental health response, the higher education, the things that we we've been talking about here in the board and things that I've been fighting for. So, I think we should all be proud. And for folks who are you know making under 300,000 as a couple or 150,000 as a individual, you'll be getting checks later this year from the state. And I'm happy to talk about more about the budget, but I know you have a lot of people. you know, the last thing I'll say is we have a a couple couple upcoming events. We're doing what we call hang with Harvey in June and we'll have our last shredding for the spring on June 6. If you want compare shredding event is in our eblast and our newsletter and you don't get our eblast, you just sign up for them to get all the information about we're doing in the neighborhood. Thank you, Har. Do we have any questions? First, thank you. Daniel's law. I'll ask you if you could just briefly describe it. and then the question is what we can do. It's the intersection essentially of public safety and mental health. and the question is what we might be able to do to help implement it in our district. It's my understanding that one reason that we often send dispatch police to 911 calls with when there's an emotional emotionally distressed person rather than mental health specialists is because we just don't have the teams in our community district especially rebell speaking so I can't really see who's asking the question but it's a really good question it's Stu. Okay, great. St. So, for people who don't know what Daniel's Law is, basically in the city in the city of Rochester, a guy named Daniel Puit and then so Daniel who had a who had real mental health issues unfortunately when the 911 called the police responded and unfortunately Daniel passed away from his interaction with the police. And what Rochester realized and what we all realize is that sometimes the response doesn't need to be a police response, it's a mental health response. And so that's what how Daniel's law was created. And the city of Rochester, like Southern California now, has a real comprehensive approach to the 911 system. The answer isn't just the police. The answer is who's the best professional to respond to that. So, we put another $8 million in to create a behavioral health crisis technical assistance center, which will help first responders understand how to respond to the mental health crisis. So, it's really upgrading our 911 system, really revamping it to make sure that we have the mental health professional to respond to mental health issu episodes. So, I think it's one is a training for our 911 system, which I think hopefully in this budget we're starting to move in that direction, and two is figuring out how we can fully implement Daniel's law across the state. You know, again, we put, you know, Maloneyy in for supportive housing beds. You know, we we need more mental health beds. We put 200, you know, basically another $30 million for supportive housing beds, another $20 million into impatient mental health beds, and we changed the category on voluntaries. All those things together with a real 911 system will help us, I think, get in the right direction. I don't think there's a one-sizefititall thing. But I do know that unless we have the support of housing beds at the end, we're never going to get to the place we need to be because you can you can involuntarily commit someone, but sooner or later they're coming out. And the other piece is making sure that on the front end like you said to that that we have a real response that's driven by mental health professionals for mental health issues. Our police are not trained in that way. You know, like I'm trained as a lawyer, but never give me an intellectual property case. I would screw it up. Police are not trained to be mental health professionals, and we just know that. And we have better systems and structures in place. Exactly, buddy. sorry, it's a long question, but it's a long answer, but it's a really complicated question. I think we're going in the right direction. Don't worry. the budget allocates 15 million just to support changes in discovery. wasn't substantially changed despite the government threats. do you know what that 15 million is going toward? Yeah, I could tell you exactly what it's going to. So 5 million for the for the DAs in New York City, five million for the DAs outside of New York City, five million for the defense lawyers. And so basically they each get $5 million. And basically what we did with discovery is what we heard in New York City was especially from our DA Manhattan DA bra we just had a representative on the phone a few minutes ago was there were cases let's say an example that there was a domestic violence case [Music] and the person who was you know was assaulted handed over their phone. So they handed over all the evidence, but they found out that a friend of the survivor had a a picture of the survivor on her phone and they just didn't know about the picture, so they didn't hand it over. And they said a case like that was dismissed where the DA attempted to provide all outstanding information but missed something because they didn't know it existed. So what we've done is there's a court case called Peoplebe. people vay and in that case it outlined basically the real specific standards of why cases should be dismissed or not. What we did is we took the standards that people be and put them into the statute. So to make sure that it was clear to all the judges whe they they where where how much were the obligations of the DAs to hand over and if they handed that over whether they complied enough to ensure that the case should go forward and that some technical mistakes like something like this where you handed you didn't hand over a footer you didn't know existed that should result in a dismissal of a case but if you don't comply with discovery hand over police records in that case the people be case was they failed to hand over 911 records they said didn't exist but it actually did exist and in that case the case was dismissed. So the judge wants to look holistically at the standard and that's how we we changed the discovery to make clear that the other change we did was if the defense wanted to object to what the DA handed over they had 35 days there's a requirement under the law that when they they're ready for trial under the speedy trial rules they have to submit a notice saying hey we're ready for trial within 35 days of that notice that if the if the defense team thinks there's something that hasn't been complied with they have 35 days to compel it or ask the judge to dismiss the case. Under the current law was much more open-ended. So, we wanted to give everyone a clear time frame, which is really what we're trying to do is make sure all the parties have good information and clear time frames. Basic question though is what what are those $5 million grants to to defend the prosecutor going to accomplish? Are they for technology or No, this is this is for staff. So, what we heard from the DA's office and the defense lawyers They just needed more staff to help comply with the obligations under discovery, more parallegals, more support staff. So, both the defense lawyers and the prosecutors got additional funds. Okay. Thanks. lastly, you come to speak with us a frequently and we really appreciate that. and you often take questions from us. and you have to my recollection never asked us for anything. what can we do? assuming we agree with you or some of your action. Yeah. You know, it's funny because I do ask Sandy for stuff like I'm like give me a resolution in support of the issue we're working on. I've done that many times. and so I will continue to ask for things. I probably won't do it publicly in a meeting, but if I there's an issue we're trying to get done legislatively, you know, we're trying to, you know, one example is, you know, we've, you know, we're talking about moving to the climate goals, but we have no publicly available charging infrastructure in lower Manhattan. We have no charging stations publicly available below 59th Street. So, things like asking the city to put publicly available charging infrastructure in a in a part of the city which is in the congestion zone, then we want people to move to electric vehicles. we talked about more Maloneyy for, you know, in the budget, we got more Maloneyy for composting. Making sure that we have more access to composting in our community, not just the composting that we're talking about on the street corner and the pickups, but also composting that goes to dirt like we have with the lower east side. There's all those things that you know, which I when you guys are doing it, I really appreciate it. I asked about the casino. Really wanted to hear back from the board about where you were on the casino and the board, you know, gave me a clear information about the casino that there's being proposed between on 1st Avenue between 38th and 42nd. So I I feel like we have a really good open dialogue and I do appreciate the board's response to this to my request. I also meet sit down with the when you guys do your capital needs and operating needs, I sit down with the chair and we talk through what your needs are and to make sure that if we're funding things, funding things that you've identified as needs in our community. so I I guess I I feel like I asked, but I'm happy to ask more. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. We we do what we can. Great. so no more questions. Thank you all. Have a great evening and we'll be, you know, we're still up here in Albany, but we'll have about another month of legislative session. So, if there are bills you want us to move forward on, I have about a dozen bills I'm trying to get done in the board. Please let me know. We have we have about, you know, about 25 legislative days left in the session. Great. Okay, the final push. Thanks very much. Thank you. we'll go back to Braa. Hi. Sorry about that. My my computer decided to update, so I was on my phone and I I want to get my notes back up. hi everyone. The most exciting thing which you'll see in the the report is that we have released our newest appointments for community board members. So welcome to all the new members. Everyone please say hi to the new members. I already feel like I know you from from your applications and everything because they were they were so good. but I'm excited to get to know you more and you can always reach out to me as well. we had over 950 applications across the burrow that our team's been working really hard on reviewing and making the final appointments and some of the boards are still finishing up those. but we're very excited for these new members now. and then the rest you can really read in the report, but I just I've been getting a lot of specific questions about term limits from people on this board. so you can always ask me but also information about maximum term limits is available on our website. I put instructions in the report on how you can find that. but that should answer your questions there. and we had a really wonderful AAPI event together with Assembly Member Grace Lee this week, sorry, last week. and feel free to look on our social media for some more about that. and finally the stops super speeders bill that the bar president participated at a rally to urge Albany to pass it. because the statistics around reckless driving and and accidents and pedestrian deaths are are really really alarming. so we are encouraging this leg legislation that would mandate speed limiter technology for the most dangerous drivers on our street. that's all I have and happy to take any questions. Tanya has a question. Hi Bara, I'm glad you touched on this super speeders. it's not only super speeders, it's people who don't respect the pedestrians on crosswalks. I personally have been run down on a crosswalk even though I hadn't ride away. So the pedestrians death and and injury go above and beyond just speed. Is there anything else that you're doing? for example, like the timing of the lights at intersections and such. That might help. Thanks. I don't know specifically about in terms of infrastructure, timing the lights. That's something we can definitely look into and perhaps our transportation team is already on it. I can definitely speak to them about it. I do know that we've done other things around traffic safety. we've worked extensively on ghost cars. you know, cars that drive recklessly and and use fake license plates that they can't get tickets. and we have a lot of we have a whole package of recommendations that we've come out with around that. because that is not only costing the city revenue, but it's also cost costing people's lives. and killing two birds with Flintstone would be wonderful if we could cut down on that. and we're always looking for more ideas on how to make our streets safer for for pedestrians and and everyone on the roads. so yeah, please feel free to share ideas like that and then I can definitely flag to our transportation analyst and our policy team as well to find out any any more things that we're working on. Thank you. Great. Great. Thank you, Brock. Seeing no more questions, we'll move on to Justin Flag from Senator Krueger's office. Good evening. nothing extra to report. Just want to point out that we have we uploaded two reports this month. One is our regular monthly newsletter that came out a couple weeks ago and then one was our budget update from earlier this week that has a lot of detail about what's in the budget. So you can take a look at both of those on the website and happy to take any questions. Due has a question for you. evening. I wanted to ask you about the substantial equivalency standards. I'll ask you to just briefly explain what that is and then I'll say that in our district we don't exactly have a plethora of yeshivas. Does it somehow still impact the schools within district six? So just quickly substantial equivalency are the standards that non-public schools have to meet to meet the state constitutional requirement for providing a sound basic education. and this has been an issue often in relation to yeshivas and and whether or not they're provide they're meeting that standard. and so this was an issue in the budget. I'll just say quickly that before I get to your specific question, Stu, Senator Krueger was very opposed to the changes to substantial equivalency that were made in the budget. if you look at our our budget update, there's a link there for a video of her speaking on the floor specifically about that issue. And I think she puts it very clearly, so I won't try to repeat what she said there, but you can find it there. in terms of this district, I mean, it applies to all non-public schools. So, if there's any, you know, private schools, even if you know, whether they're religious or not, they all, have to abide by those substantial equivalency standards. So when we change the method by which those standards are met then it it does apply to those schools as well. Good. Do we have any other questions? Okay. Thank you Justin. we'll move on to Payton Schaefus from Senator Gonzalez's office. Hi dad, but have you taken questions? Do we have any questions for Peyton? Report was right. I guess we we might have one question just I know now that MSBI is closed. We're wondering what the next steps are. I think everyone knows we're very concerned about the lack of of hospital care in our district, especially the lower portion of the district. Mhm. So, is there something that the senator is working on in in Albany to help us with that? Yes, absolutely. One of our priorities obviously has been making sure that Belleview has adequate funding is able to have the increased capacity that it's going to need for the additional patients that will be going there. We're also continuing to fight for legislation like the Lich and statewide healthcare assessment measures that will help you know change the ways by which some of these decisions are decisions are made. that won't necessarily undo the damage that's done by the closure not made by this trail. Part of the goal with the statewide healthcare assessment legislation would be to identify healthcare distressed zones, areas that are in need of more investment. So that way more investment could be directed there. And we do have a resolution in support of Lich. So hopefully it comes up again this this year, I guess. Great. Thank you. Any other questions? No. Thanks very much. We'll move on to Mackie Dentley from Congressman Adler's office. Hi there everyone. the board happy to take any questions. Okay. Report has a question. There was some something in the report about local's $50 million rental aid program. Can you explain what that is? Yeah. So, I don't have the details in front of me, but Army Nyler did write a letter in support of funding for is it HBCAP? I forget the acronym. but in support of adequate funding for that in you know light of all these potential cuts with budget and you know there's a new state program that will assist with rental assistance from what I've seen. I don't know the exact details about it. I know some of my colleagues would have more details on that but that was announced I think two weeks ago. but I'm happy to get more information and, you know, follow up with on that if you like. Okay, great. Go ahead. I think it's like a section eight, a statewide section 8 like health, isn't it? again, it's been a minute, so I'm not entirely sure. That's what I read, but I'm happy to follow up on that. Okay, thanks very much. we'll move on to Shinray Lee from the Independent Budget Office. He's here. Oh, great. Thank you. Hi, good evening everyone. my name is Simray. I'm the community engagement specialist from the New York City Independent Budget Office. so could I just get a show of hands who is familiar with our agency? Oh, good number of people, not not you know, still some strugglers. So, I'm here to introduce us. we've been around, we are a city agency. but we are independent in the sense that we don't report to any elected officials. our primary function is to provide datadriven information on recommend services, programs, etc. the budget to the public and city council members. we do this through three charter mandate reports that come out in conjunction with the mayor's budget plans. So we are currently analyzing the executive budget that just came out earlier this month. our analysis will be coming out in a couple of weeks or actually next week. so stay tuned for that. otherwise we also do presentations. I'm a relatively new member of the team, so we're kind of doing more outreach. we're doing presentations at schools. So if you have a high school that wants to learn more about the budget, we can come through. we'll also be doing a budget 101 workshop geared towards community board members. I have some flyers over here that you can grab or scan the QR code over there to register. There are three sessions to choose from. it's on May 28th and 29th. we'll be going through the structure, the process, timeline of the New York City budget. so if you don't know what you know PS or OTPS means, you should come. Or if you don't know what an expense budget versus the capital budget is or how that works, we'll go through that. and we'll also cover a little bit about how the community board needs assessment fits into the budget process. yeah, apart from the charter mandated reports, we also publish reports year round about we have 50 analysts who are experts in things from housing, environment, infrastructure, education. we released a report recently on the age of school buildings for example and how accessible they are. and there's a lot more reports. We testified recently on the street vendors permit cap. so go to our website ibo.nyc.gov and you can see what we have. and we accept questions from the public on the budget and any other budget related data questions. we also provide like reports from council members and the public. So send us an email over there. Grab a flyer. Sign up for the budget 101. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. I highly recommend all of our new members sign up. I'm going to sign up, too. Y make a day of it. Yes. It's it's really important information. I'm really Okay. next we have Evelyn Colado from Controller Lander's office. Yes. good evening. Manhattan B director for New York City Control Brett Lander. Thank you for the opportunity to address you tonight. tonight I'd like to bring your attention to two of our latest reports. The first one is a contract primer. we released it as part of our efforts to provide the public with a straightforward to the basics of city contracting workflows and essential solistation methods. the document is divided into three overarching sections including the primer with information on key entities in New York City contracting, an overview of the New York City contracting cycle, definitions of core contract categories and solicitation methods and more. It also has a section on public resources. And the last se section is a set of helpful tables for navigating the primer and running searches in the systems outlined in section two. The other report that I'd like to bring to your attention is the streets for people open streets and the future of public space management in New York City. in this report we evaluated how the open streets program is has evolved over the last five years. tracing the shift in the size, scale and geographic locations of open streets over time and documenting the various challenges that operators face in effectively managing and and programming open streets. It is informed by an analysis of publicly available data along with over 30 interviews with open street operators. public realm experts and a review of global best practices for public space pedestrianization. The report proposes strategic recommendations to strengthen the program into a thriving fixture of New York City's urban landscape. For this and other audits and reports, you can visit us at controller.nyc.gov. Thank you and good evening. Do we have any questions? Okay, great. Thank you very much. We'll move on then to Sophie Sakor from Assembly Member Bores's office. Sophie, are you there? Sorry about that. Yes, here. nothing to add from the report other than we have free legal services that will be at our office this Friday from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. and that wasn't in the report, but I can take any questions from the report now if you have any. Do we have any questions for Okay, seeing none, we'll move on to Spencer Spencer from Council Member Rivera's office. He's going to be accompanied by Katie Lo. Hi everyone. Katie Lo from Council Member River's office. I've been the CD6 rep for I don't know seven years now and it's time to pass the torch. So I want to introduce everyone to Spencer He's been working in our office part-time for two years for for almost two years. So he's very well seasoned. He's very familiar with a lot of issues in the area. He's been working very closely on East 28th Street. so he's going to be the new CD6 rep. So I wanted to introduce him and say bye to everybody. I'll miss you on the second Wednesday of every month. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Very good. Hi everyone. Very nice to meet you all. as Katie mentioned, I've been working for Council Member Rivera for a couple years now, part time, helping out with budget and outreach most recently, but checking into CB6. pretty familiar with the issues around here. I grew up in village as well, not quite in CB6, but close enough to find that. So, I'm I'm excited to get to know everyone better and yeah, look forward to working. Thank you. Thank welcome. Thank you. Right. Do we have any questions? just, you know, start off on a Okay, it's a good thing. It's a good thing. Thank you. Thank you very much. all right. We're going to move on to the public session. Has anyone signed up to speak in the public session? They have. quite a few. all right. You will be granted three minutes to speak. we will start with Sha Lamuru. Sean, are you here? Shawn is a resident of Manhattan Community District 6 and wishes to speak to the board on increasing green infrastructure in Manhattan Community District 6. Mr. Lamaru, you have three minutes. You may begin your remarks now. All right. I I live in your city and I did present a deck, but I guess it's not there. Basically, I would like to see increase green infrastructure in our community. as many know this reduces heat island effect, absorbs flood waters, enhance local biodiversity, it improves our mental and physical health. the more we dedicate public space to people and natural landscapes instead of asphalt and concrete for personal cars, our local grows, our property values increase, and our streets become more livable. as also many people might know, in East Midtown, property values over $1,100 per square feet. So, a single 15 by 20 foot area represents $350,000 worth of real estate. And oftent times through and walking around, I see a lot of just barren concrete that we could be using for our benefit. so I've submitted three draft resolutions to the board. it's my first meeting so I hope that's how it works. and I hope we can adopt it. the first one is near-term immediately fixing what's broken, replacing the 40 plus missing trees where there is an already a tree bed. and so yeah, asking to have this completed as soon as possible so they have the full summer to root. I did check New York City Parks and they are planning on planting seven trees in total this year in our district and they do not take ex request to plant trees. and medium to long term as the city continues to daylight more intersections and leaves behind unused asphalt. We should be converting these spaces to useful green and public infrastructure. I'm calling for a modest goal of converting 7% of parking spaces annually as a successful congestion relief pricing has already reduced 7% of cars in our central business district. And as a long-term solution, I'm calling for a bold redesign of our avenues that put pedestrians, transit, and community first. Our streets should reflect 85% of residents who do not commute by car, likely more with congestion pricing. and even the third avenue redesign proposal still indicates about 30% of the streets driving vehicles. we should design a street that reflects our values, not only permanently better. I'm asking for two-way bike lanes on all avenues in our district. as many people know, during commuting hours and the weekends, bike lanes are already crowded and given the expanded recently and on First and Second Avenue, which is great, but yeah, it's still crowded. so yeah, and then I was curious too like how often readers plan on redesigning these avenues. if we're still leaving 30% to private vehicles, is it going to be another 5 years until we reduce it to 20 and then another 5 years until 10? So, it would be great to just redesign once for the future. And yeah, I just love living in this area and think that we should build upon the success of congestion relief pricing to accelerate our transition to a more equitable and livable city. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. We did get your attachments. we will provide them to the committee. Three minutes is not enough time to do them justice, but we will provide them to the to the board members for further review and we'll invite you to the appropriate committee to talk about them. All right. It does seem like we've missed an elected official representative. So, we're with everyone's seged to Patrick Hill from from Council Member Keith P's office. Hi everyone. I I don't have really anything to add to our report. aside from I do want to add one correction. so we listed the DA chemole plaza as our location for the shred event that we're doing later on this month on May 31st. That is the intended location. We're just waiting on confirmation from the parks department. so as of right now, that is TBD, but just wanted to make that correction that we'll get the confirmed location sent around to the board as soon as that is confirmed. But that'll be happening on May 31st from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Do we have any questions for Patrick? I don't think we do. Thank you very much. Of course. Have a great night. Yeah. All right. Back to the public session. Cat Hartley. Cat Hartley, are you here? Cat Hartley, I see you're online. Cat Hartley is a resident of this district and wishes to address the board on the topic of food waste. Miss Hartley, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Great. Thank you. Hi everyone. Good evening. U my name is Cat Hartley. As mentioned, I'm a community community member. I wanted to talk today about food waste, specifically bill 0299, which was introduced last year. and aims to address the issue of food waste by reducing civil penalties and encouraging more food service establishments to donate leftover food. Over a million New Yorkers are considered food insecure. Yet many of these food service establishments are throwing away over 250 thousand 50,000 tons of food collectively every year. And so a lot of this perfectly good food ends up in landfills worsening both food insecurity in the community but also climate change as well. There are existing good Samaritan laws but despite those they protect donors from liability but many food establishments hesitate to donate because there are just unclear guidelines and a lot of logistical hurdles. so this food waste continues to contribute to rising greenhouse gas emissions. and then through my own volunteer work across burrows, I've seen how food insecurity impacts communities, but more so just the stark contrast often between food waste on the street and food banks needing more food, often on the same block. this bill aims to reduce that food waste and improve food security by creating a more structured program, incentivizing businesses to donate that excess food, with waved civil penalties on certain violations and then clarifying more of those donation guidelines so that that fresh food is reaching hungry New Yorkers in need and not ending up in landfills. The bill is currently with the committee on small business. it's been there since early last year. I've also been in contact with Councilman Eric Botcher's office who sits on the committee and just am here today to ask you all to continue or to start supporting the progress of Bill 0299 so that we can reduce that food waste, fight hunger, and just build a more sustainable and equitable city for all New Yorkers. That's all. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you very much for your remarks. All right. the next 13 speakers are all speaking on one way or the other on the same topic. So we will start with those. Jeremy Barnum, are you here? All right. Will you please make your remarks? You will have three minutes. You may begin now. Hi, my name is Jeremy Barman. I'm president. I want to focus on narrowly on the noise issues associated with the proposed open air rooftop dance qu. The New York City Noise Code says that, and I quote, "Unreasonable noise means any excessive or emotionally loud sound that disturbs the peace, comfort, or repose of a reasonable person of normal sensitivities." The history of the space matters. When the code says you're a reasonable person of normal sensitivities, I can tell you I am significantly less sensitive than a normal person. And yet, when the music was playing on the rooftop before, I couldn't sleep at all. It was as if the boom box had been in my bedroom. The fact that the noise levels routinely violated the code suggests a steep uphill climb for the new owner to establish that the space will be code compliant. Another reason the dispute is relevant is that it establishes that 311 is a toothless enforcement mechanism. Many calls were made and nothing changed. If the rooftop dance club is not code compliant, we are facing years of sleepless nights while we wait for the city to enforce. So it is imperative that the developer establish with certainty that the procedures will be enforcably code compliant from day one. In that context, there are some aspects of the developer's acoustical report that are quite concerning. The only test done on the roof was to measure the ambient noise in order to provide a baseline against which to measure the future sound equipment volume. From that perspective, the report recommends that the volume be capped at 85 dbc with the cover open. What this establishes is that the operator plans to operate the rooftop dance club with the cover open and believes that restricting the volume to 85 dbc will avoid unreasonable noise. The volume recommendation is based on a difference between ambient noise and noise generated for the ambient noise test ended at 12:30 a.m. But the request is to operate until 4 a.m. I looked it up. 85 dbc is about the sound level of common powered tools loud enough to be tiring and potentially harmful if you stay in it for a full workday without protection. So to put it in plain English, the developers proposing an establishment that will produce a noise level comparable to common power tools and which would require ear protection if it were part of the workplace 30 ft from my bedroom window at 3:30 in the morning. This is simply not reasonable. And let's remember we are talking here about a late night dance club atmosphere on a rooftop. Isn't the literal point of such a place thumping base with the roof open? Wouldn't that be the fundamental appeal to would be customers? When the core commercial appeal of an establishment is in direct conflict with community interests, the risks are elevated. We ask that this proposal be assessed in a computerized manner. now in order to avoid protracted disputes after the fact time is up. Thank you. Good timing. Thank you for your remarks. and just for everyone in case it wasn't clear the topic of this and the next few statements will be on resolution for you which is on our agenda tonight regarding liquor licenses for the Gramarcy Park Hotel. Next person speaking on this is Caitlyn Macy. Caitlyn Macy is a resident of Manhattan Community District 6. Caitlyn, are you here? Yeah. Hi. All right. Caitlyn, you have three minutes to make your remarks on this topic. We begin now. I also live at Lexington Avenue across the street from the Tracy Park Hotel. During the last iteration of the hotel, open top bar opened with a retractable roof that played loud music into the morning hours. This despite the fact that the hotel stands in an entirely all sides residential neighborhood. Unsurprisingly, the bar was the cause of many noise complaints to 311 and just as many direct complaints to the embattled front desk staff of the hotel. In 2023, I read that the hotel had been sold to Mr. Morris's MCR group. I moved to you all to inquire as to whether CB6 has any guidelines in place for rooftop establishments. the way say community board 5 does and I received an email back from Miss Barafherty to the negative. I then also in September of 2023 wrote to Arlene Harrison in her capacity as head of the Grammar Park Block Associates expressing the same concerns. She urged me to put my concerns in a forwardable letter which I did. I never heard back. So, when renovations started, I phoned the New York State Liquor Authority myself and was told they had the application from MCR for multiple additional bars with long, and by long, I mean until 4 in the morning opening hours. The man I spoke to explained that they take their lead from the community board's support or lack of support for any given project. So, in April, I approached CB6 expressing my concerns, and my letter was read out loud at the limited hearing on April 24th. A hearing Miss Harrison never told any of her constituents about despite regular emails about far less pressing issues such as Samuel Ruggles's birthday. He's the guy who designed GCY Park. Even if you view this through the most charitable lens and chalk it up to oversight, it remains the case that the actual limited hearing, Miss Harrison, in an apparent attempt to undermine my concerns, is on record dismissing me as an irrelevant complainant and suggesting that she had successfully muzzled my complaint, saying, quote unquote, "That situation is under control." I have only 3 minutes to speak. So you might be asking yourself why I would take the bulk of the time revisiting the fact that many of you already know, namely that Grammarcy Park Block Associates does not reflect the views of the constituents it purports to represent. The reason is that there's a ripple effect. At least one member of your board is on record at the April hearing saying that the support of the block associates for the hotel is quote unquote the most important thing in his decision-making. The state liquor authority in turn has cited the community board's support as the most important thing in their decision-making. Therefore, the fact that at the limited hearing, actual tenants who live on the park were not represented demands a return of the proposal to the business affairs and licensing committee for re-re. Thank you. All right. Thank you for those remarks. next on the list is Samuel Albert, a resident of CB CD6 this district who wishes to speak on this matter. Mr. Albert, you have three minutes. You may begin now. Good evening. My name is Sammy Albert. I live at 39 BC Park North and have for 20 years born. I would first like to thank the transportation committee members for working to help find solutions to the traffic issue facing us on 21st Street because of the construction at 38 Gy Park North and the closing off of the traffic and bike lane aggravating an already poorly passable street. While disappointed with the lack many meaningful assistance from the Department of Transportation, the transportation committee's insights and efforts are greatly appreciated. Second, I wish to comment on the action being considered for the Grimy Park Hotel by the business affairs and licensing committee. I am certainly glad that the structure is being revitalized after so many years of standing empty, but I'm very perturbed in the process by which the licenses to the hotel are being considered. There was a single notice in the door of the building whose sidewalk is not only covered with scaffolding discouraging pedestrian traffic, but also an active site for the disposal of debris from the building. This hardly seems to be an effective way to solicit meaningful community input. I and my neighbors are concerned about the proposed changes both indoors and outdoors as well as the number of licenses being requested. While a bar and restaurant are certainly appropriate to a hotel as service and convenience to guests, the planned 240 person quote speak easy quote in the basement as well as the private club on the roof and the large sidewalk cafe are clearly intended to draw outside patrons. The effect that this will have on the quiet ne quiet residential neighborhood of Gracy Park can be nothing but detrimental. Lexington Avenue and 21st Street are both poorly suited for the increased amount of late night vehicular traffic. these plan changes will bring. Further, as the license is being requested for 7 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., I am worried about late night disruption of patrons that patrons may bring. None of these issues were raised at the business affairs and licensing committee meeting. Indeed, anyone there who purported to speak for my neighborhood certainly did not solicit my opinion or to the best of my belief and knowledge those of my neighbors. I therefore request that the business affairs licensing committee halt consideration of the license applications. I ask that they reopen consideration of the application and have the opportunity to hear from the entirety of the neighborhood. That indeed is the purpose of such meetings. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is John Moore, a resident of Manhattan Community District 6. Mr. Moore, are you here? I am. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak. I live at 44 Grammarcy Park North and I have three generations in this building. my 90-year-old mother lives in this building. I have raised my family in this building for the last 25 years and my son who has also written a letter alongside mine. I want to concur with the great comments made by my fellow neighbors in the Grammarcy Park area and express my opposition not only to the proposed idea of a rooftop nightclub outdoor seating for multiple bars as well as the wine bar that I understand is part of the 38 Garcy Park development. Effectively, the result of these liquor establishments at the hotel on the outside plus a club as well as the wine bar will tw will turn 21st Street into a corridor of bar establishments from Park Avenue all the way to third. And I clearly wonder why that is necessary and also what it will do to the historic character of our neighborhood. Grammarcy Park is one of the most important historic establishments, neighborhoods and gifts to the city of New York and we are turning it into a bar corridor. Okay. that is a tragedy. It is the responsibility not only the business affair and licensing committee but this community board to review this rigorously and incorporate the views of the neighborhood as well as the historians who value and want to preserve the character of this neighborhood to seriously consider if we need to transform this great historic jewel not only for the city of New York but our entire country into a bar corridor. We have plenty of liquor establishments on Park Avenue. We have liquor establishments and bar alternatives on Third. what we are proposing to do, I think, would forever transform and lose the character of the neighborhood. And so I concur with my fellow neighbors who have expressed their opposition to the idea of an late night club on top of the hotel as well as the outdoor bars and the wine bar at 38. Thank you very much. Please reconsider and establish better due process both at the business affairs and licensing committee as well as the community board process. We the neighborhoods and New Yorkers do not need this. Right. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is Sydney Stein, a resident of this district. Sydney Stein, are you here? All right. You have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Thank you. I'm also a resident with 39 BCY which is the corner of 21st and third and basically this will echo the comments made by 18 other people on this we are already inundated with bars nightclubs the establishments on Park Avenue and Third Avenue. not commenting on the noise from the music, but I think you also have to worry about the noise from the traffic. With these establishments being open till 3:30, 4:00 in the morning, I'm sure character will be very heavy with Ubers and limousines. there have been incidents, thinking about a bar on it was on 22nd Street between Park and Madison. Frequently the patients of these places will use green street as a bathroom or even themselves of somebody after effects of drinking for all hours in the morning. so independent of the noise from their usage which certainly think will be serious. We have other consideration at the street noise and the traffic as well as public safety. Thank you J. All right. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is Abigail Melon, a resident of this district. Abigail, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. My name is Abby Melan and I'm resident in the 44 neighborhood of John Morris. I speak to the issue of these licensing for restaurants and bars at the new hotel. I too am opposed to granting licenses particularly for activities for the outdoor seating drinking that is proposed that is downstairs to the main street restaurant at the new hotel. and I particularly want to draw attention to the charter for Grammar Park when it was drawn up in 1831 by Samuel Rogals. He specified that it was to be an entirely residential neighborhood, that the park itself was to be entirely residential and there were to be no commercial activities on facing the park. and this facet of the original charter for Grand Mercy Park has been reiterated and confirmed by the landmark commission, the landmarks preservation commission. there was an earlier request to open a wine bar at 38y Park in 2020 and that request was turned down. That request for drivers for a bar license was turned down for the reasons of the preservation of the neighborhood and the reasons of the landmark the landmark commission had continued to recommend that the charter of Samuel be observed and be respected. So I too think that the request for a license for liquor licences particularly for restaurants that are going to be at street level should be returned to the licensing commission for the consideration and the board community board should ado oppose the branding license for any outside activity from the military. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is Lewis Mayor, a resident of this district. Lewis, are you here? Lewis Mayor going once, going twice. He he he is here. I will I'm promoting him to a panelist, but he but he is here. Okay, he should be able to speak. Hi. All right, Louis, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. thank you for for promoting me here, I guess, to panelist. I guess my question is more about the way that the hotel is intending to deal with individuals that are that are either waiting outside. Now, the prior hotel, like step back, the current developers of the hotel have an existing property in the city that has meshed quite well with their their neighborhood on the west side of town. this Gy Park Hotel, previously had nightlife operations in this neighborhood and did a pretty decent job of managing the flow in and out of patrons largely by keeping most of those patrons inside and managing them within the lobby of the hotel. and just love to understand and raise for the the consideration of the board thoughts around how that would be managed with under the current management. the the the concerns raised by the the prior speaker are relevant from a historical perspective obviously. and the method in which residents are affected by both vehicular traffic and foot traffic and noise from revelers in and out of the night establishments. I think are manageable but would have to be handled carefully if our if they're to be done well as it relates to how the how the hotel manages patrons in the neighborhood. Thank you for those remarks. next person on the list is David H. Johnson, a resident of this district. David, are you in here? Yes, he is. Mr. Johnson, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin ow. I've been on the floor building for 25 years. Our concern about this project is about this project was not conveyed by the Grammy Park Block Association in the April 24 meeting. For 100 years, we've shared the corner of 21st in Lexington with the Gramarcy Park Hotel and we hope the hotel and fun Lexington will remain great neighbors. We impressed by MCR and its ambition to build a fivestar hotel. However, we have serious concerns about the impact of the hotel on Ramsey Park historic district and our building. We're worried about noise, crowding, and other problems. This isn't a boutique hotel with a cafe. Proposal is nearly 200 rooms with five bars, 93 outdoor seats for eating and drinking. The large rooftop club and a 200 plus person speak easy and seller. If licensers are approved as proposed, this hotel could unleash on our residential neighborhood a serious public nuisance. There are three concerns. One is the rooftop club and the noise adequately discussed by other speakers. Second is the outdoor dining and drinking which never existed before. The request is for 93 seats with service from 7 a.m. to 4 a.m. This is unprecedented and not practical within the property line. plans don't count for pedestrians, fire department access to sand device servers. Concern is the seller speak easy again never existed before. We're worried about queuing and congregate to enter and exit the sedans club and not in keeping with the gramy park area. We ask that community board 6 should require conversation between MCR and neighboring buildings in the weeks ahead. Thereafter, a refined plan should go back to your business affairs licensing committee. The time to determine what's reasonable is now instead of noise and other complaints later. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is Brian P. Manning, a resident of this district. Mr. Manning, are you here? I am. I'm on Zoom. All right. You have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Hi, community board 6. Thank you for taking my statement. My name is Brian Manning. I'm a resident of one Lexington Avenue. I'm writing writing in regarding this item of the liquor licenses for the Grammarcy Park Hotel. let me first say Grammarcy Park Hotel holds personal significance to me. I proposed to my wife in Grammarcy Park. We were married at the hotel and years later moved across the street before its closure. We often hosted colleagues, friends, and family at Myelino, the Rosebart, and GPH was our choice for out of town visitors. As a local entrepreneur, I support a revitalized GPH that fits the neighborhood ethos. That said, we have serious concerns about the significant deviations from the prior operations, including large outdoor seating serving liquor from 7 in the morning to 4:00 a.m. in the morning, a new subterranean nightclub, open roof events till 4:00 a.m. The plan lacks details to avoid negatively impacting the quality of life in an otherwise quiet residential area with schools and places of worship. For example, nothing about limiting sidewalk footprint, seats, liquor serving hours, protocols for avoiding sidewalk gatherings, waiting for nightclub access, soundproofing, retractable roof closing during night events. We don't believe these concerns were adequately addressed upon reviewing the replay of the April 25th business affairs and licensing committee meeting. we hope community board 6 will lead in resolving the disconnect by requiring immediate conversation ideally between the developer and the representatives of the directly neighboring buildings to discuss and align on a resolution to these issues and to send this back to the business affairs and licensing committee for review. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is David Bernstein. a resident of this district. Mr. Bernstein, are you here? Yes. All right. Can we get a mic to him? thank you for the opportunity to say how much we welcome back the Grammy Park Hotel, but not one with these plans. This redevelopment represents a major shift for our community. While a Grammy Park Hotel has long been part of the area, what's now proposed is not simply a reopening. This is something new. a full-scale nightlife and entertainment complex in the heart of the residential community. What we do know has been spotty and frequently changing. That uncertainty has fueled chatter about private donations or back room arrangements with the ground mercy park association. This all may reflect how little reliable public information input there's been so far. To that point, plans appear to include a rooftop with retractable roof till 4:00 a.m. Another 200 person plus e easy described are various as a private members club or priv or or for public outdoor exceeding 10 ft along both Lexington Avenue 21st Street. This isn't just hospitality, it's volume. For example, members club adding traffic not only at night but during busy afternoons, visit drop offs, deliveries, member lunches. Taken together, the venue's hours and sidewalk activity represent the scale out of sync with this community. Many of us generally appreciated the way the previous hotel operated. The staff were friendly, the door man respectful, the atmosphere generally quiet neighborly. It was part of the block rarely disruptive, but even then the roof path alone caused real noise issues, especially late at night. The bar on Lexington Avenue often drew lingering crowds, snake past entrances, double bar cars, and patrons loitering into the night. We've seen what strong community advocacy can accomplish. The Ramsey Park Ocean proudly recalls that his advocacy with the former cowall club site citing the need to protect residents from disruption. It's as if this was moved and but perhaps waiting. this isn't about opposing change. Indeed, I'm proposing some. It's about shaping change in a way that strengthens the neighborhood rather than overwhelms it as the community develops and it must be must develop in the way in the best traditions of the values CB6 and particularly the grammar park association works to protect in so words to promote public safety crime prevention historic preservation and quality of life in that tradition development shouldn't mean disruption it should mean growth that fits the context and investment that represents the people here to site Jane Jacobs cities have the capability of providing function for everybody only because and only when we are created by everybody. This isn't about posing change. Change should be done with not to the community. All right. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is Robin Brener, a resident of this district. Miss Brener, are you here? I am here. All right. You have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Okay. First of all, thank you for this platform to for for me to be heard. This is a very it's a very emotional heartfelt thing. I'm living in Grammarcy Park for 40 years. I live at Fort Lexington. I've been next to the Grammy. So, I've been been here for quite some time. The my apartment does not abut that building. I'm on I would be kind of like across the courtyard. My life suffered so because of the music coming from the Grammy Park Hotel. I even had their sound people in my apartment. My windows were shaking. If they so neat to have music that travels, I would like for them to maybe give us some city windows. something that would help us help me with the sound. I see patients. I'm in the health field. I see patients at 8:00 in the morning and there were days I went to work just stressed and distressed. I can't tell you how many times I called the police 311. I called the hotel and you could just tear your hair out when you're just falling on deaf ears. So, I hope that tonight I'm not falling on deaf ears. No pun intended. but please please hear us. This is just and this this is no environment for a DJ. This is Grammar Park. It's a it's a gem. It's a treasure of her neighborhood. So, please let's preserve that. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is Jane Studley. representing Sage House. Miss Studley, are you here? Yes, I'm here. Okay, you have three minutes. You may begin now. Okay. Hi, thank you for everybody listens to me. I'm the new residents moved to this area because I think this place is really beautiful and I love the history story. So I like the peace and if the wine bar they open until 4 in the morning I think is really affect our older people's life and many in our building many people they heard it they were open until 4 in the morning everybody was upset that's my most in concern about it rested I agree all the before the people they said we have to keep this area is beautiful and the prosperity because they have the you you have some control about it. Thank you everybody. Thank you for your remarks. next in next on the list is Sean Brady who represents the Grammarcy Park Block Association. Mr. Brady, are you here? Yeah. Mr. Brady, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. the chairman of the quality of life community park association. I just must say first of all in reference to the comments about how the block association approach this we approach this the same way that we approach every bar that's been closed in our neighborhood. I've been personally going to the boss committee or the now business committee meetings for pretty consistently for about 15 years other than for a couple years during COVID and in fact the people whose concerns about night life on third avenue we've been actively fighting new bars on third avenue since the since the 38 park north bar that we fought and I was one of the leaders of that so I'm very sensitive to the to the ISS issues of nightlight in our neighborhood. I'm also personally sensitive to the issues of noise from the rooftop or very smart noise. I was probably one of the people who called 31 the most because I'm in 24 and the sound from the rooftop came directly out to me. So, like I said, we approached it the same way that we did with any other provider. When Tyler Morris we found out that he was taking over the hotel, we approached him. We approached him with concerns of the community. Chelsea's concerns, for example, are being solicited and forwarded directly to him. and they did something that no bar has ever done. When we approached them in the same way, they commissioned an acoustical report and they suggested actual upgrades to their sound system that will limit the amount of sound, the volume of their stereo throughout the hotel at any time, even if a DJ or a staff member wanted to turn it up. And they put that in their stipulations for the license. So satisfied with the interior, right? We also looked at the sidewalk. The sidewalk itself, there's two parts. They have to get a a liquor license, but they also have to get a license with sidewalk. So that's going to be discussed at a future bus license meeting. and we'll all be, you know, interested in exactly how that go. the the most important thing for us was the replacement of two really bad operators, Amy Rosen and Steve Green, who ran the Grammy Park Block Grammy Park hotel as a nightlife a nightlife attraction rather than as a hotel. We looked as we always do at proprietor proprietor's history and we looked at the hotels that NCR has in New York and they have no complaints. They have fitted into the neighborhood as somebody else has mentioned nicely. This is supposedly they're they're planning to cut the number of rooms. Someone mentioned 200 rooms. That's down from nearly 400 previous hotel. So that's also going to be a good impact on traffic in the neighborhood which I think will largely offset the increase in traffic from from the bars that they'll have in the hotel which prior bars had hotel the prior hotel had bars and they were very rockets everybody knows. so we approached it the same way we did talk reached out to the proprietor our concerns were discussed and met and we present in our conclusion at the business license here as discussed I hear everybody's concerns everybody that is time and I completely understand and I understand and and that is time one person that suggest suggested that I would pay off another hotel developer who I never even met until the last meeting. I really want to say you'll earn my lawyer. All right. next on the list is Donald Bernstein, representative of the applicant in question. Mr. Bernstein, are you here? Yes, I'm here. All right. You have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Thank you. Good evening everybody. My name is Donald Bernstein. I'm the attorney for Tyler Morris and MCR Development. first I want to thank the business affairs committee for its unanimous support of our application and the tremendous enthusia and enthusiastic endorsement from the Grammy Park Block Association. The association in doing its due diligence has recognized the tremendous importance of reopening this iconic hotel and expressed their complete confidence in Tyler and the MCR team. I have been practicing in this area of law for many, many years and I have rarely seen such fervent and passionate support from a community organization as we have here. This hotel has had a liquor license for 90 years. It has had a stream of owners over the past 60 years or so. MCR, the current owner, is the third largest hotel owner and operator in the country with a portfolio that includes the TWWA Hotel at JFK and the Highline Hotel at 10th Avenue. It is probably the most qualified and experienced hotel owner and operator in the Grammycy Park Hotel's history. Prior owners of the past 25 years that have apparently created some issues with the community have included nightlife operators such as Steven Greenberg, boutique hotel operators Ian Shrager and real estate entrepreneurs who are not hotel operators. MCR, however, has a long history of owning many, many hotels throughout the country and will be operating a five-star hotel. We met with your business and affairs committee last month. We complied with all of their requirements. We posted notice of the meeting on the hotel front door in Lexington Avenue. We sent a photo of that to the community board office. We completed the questionnaire, including all the operational issues. That was all before the committee. In fact, as someone noted, the committee had a letter in opposition to the application. That was discussed. The concerns were discussed. So, the committee did do its job. In terms of anyone missing that meeting, you also, as you know, post your agenda on your website. Anybody in the community that is concerned always can check that website and know that a matter is being discussed at a committee meeting. Tyler attributes great importance to the character and quality of his hotel operation. it is not a dance club. This is not a nightclub. The hotel has had a 4 a.m. license going back to at least the 1980s if not earlier. towards that end of ensuring the quality of the hotel, he commissioned a full acoustic study by Alan Firestein who's the preeMenint sound acoustician of the city well known to the state liquor authority. that exhaustive study was provided to your committee and it includes two pages of recommendations to ensure that the sound will not negatively impact neighbors. And even as important, if not more important, you have to keep in mind that right below the rooftop and above the restaurant are guests paying upwards of $1,000 or more maybe for guest rooms. And the last thing any experienced operator such as Tyler Morris would do is shoot himself in the foot by creating that would disturb them. Thank you that we thank you and we hope we have your support as well. All right. Thank you. we have now gotten to all of the speakers who duly submitted registrations for the public session by the deadline for tonight. That concludes the speakers list for the public session. Bang. Moving on. Minutes from the April 9th full board meeting were distributed to board members by the board office. If there is no objection, we will adopt the minutes as drafted. Board members, if you object to adopting the minutes, you may raise your hand. Seeing no objections, the minutes from the April 9th full board, excuse me, meeting are adopted. They will soon be available on the CB6 website. We are saying goodbye to four members of the board who will be greatly missed. They have made amazing contributions to our community. and those four-time board members will be moving on to serve the community in other ways. David Loenstein, who joined us in 2023, is moving and going on to other things. Libya Shrenik is not available to join us this evening, but has promised to come back to say goodbye the next month. Majed Abdul Samad joined the board in 2022 and has been a huge influence on our land use and waterfront committee, but he will also serve as a public member of that many of that committee. So, he is not going away. Susan Steinberg joined the board in 20 in 2006 and has served on many of our committees, most recently as the calm experience voice on a business affairs and licensing committee and the land use and waterfront committee. Susan has generously agreed to stay on as public member of our land use and waterfront committee to help us with our advocacy for the Beth Israel site. Susan wanted to say a few words. Susan, you're muted. Susan, thank you very much, Sandy. It really has been a very quick 19 years. Some of you may remember this name, but when I joined in 2006, Lyall Frank was the chair of the board. He went on to become a judge. And the district manager was Tony Carina, whom Jesus supplanted. So, I've been around, but and I know that when I first joined, I thought, "Oh my god, it's such an August body and they deal with such significant issues." And what was the topic of my first meeting? Herb cuts. And I thought, oh well. But I went on to learn that there are really a lot there are issues big and small. And this community board, any community board is really the first line of defense for and and of protection for the people who live here. It's really a very important job. I've learned a lot and I've made some great relationships. We have wonderful people both new and old or older on the committee. Our electives are really first rate and their staff are terrific. So, I've enjoyed everything like an old soldier. I'll just kind of quietly fade away except for land use and waterfront. And I'm I'm Thank you very much for allowing me to say this goodbye. We're going to miss you, Susan. I have her own committee. Yes, some of us are lucky enough to join her the committee she's on. but welcome to the eight new members. I would like each of you to give a very brief introduction and let us know one important thing we should know about you. We're not going to use the timer, but you can see that we appreciate brevity at this point in the meeting. so first off we have Liz Burr. I think Liz is online. Yep. Yes, I am. Here I am. Hello. Hi. So, what one thing you'd like us to know about you? let's see. I have been living in Kips Bay for 16 years in the same unit and I've been a renter this whole time, but I really love the community.

Okay. Will Perry I work in housing and financial coaching and so both those things are really important to me. but a lot of the stuff is really important to me. where we have Omari who cannot be with us this evening traveling but it was short notice so thank you for everybody who did come Valero and Cat's already attended a meeting in person to call me out neighborhood almost 10 years it's something I aspire to and One fun fact, yes, I did go to committee meeting for this, but I am very very invested in healthcare justice. so that is the committee that I was eager to invest in. Thank you very much. Great. David Woods. Yes, my name is David Woods. My spouse told me to listen more and shut up.

On May the 20th, which is next Tuesday. it's from 5:00 to 7:00. It's it's virtual, but we do have a resolution against locating a casino on this site, which is 1st Avenue between East 38th and 41st Streets.

Part of our ongoing beautifification on the waterfront. We're asking for an interim activation that can be done quickly.

And we we passed the same thing unanimously for Spark previous. All right. If there's no objection, we'll now vote on the resolution. Please mark your ballots. And do you have a report, Gabe? Actually, I was going to talk about the meeting on 20. Oh, sorry. That's not yet. I wait my reporting interest in time. Good evening. we have a couple resolutions from transportation tonight. the first is a request for a no parking sign that's currently located in front of 39 GC Park North. We're asking DOT on feedback from the the residents and the board of 39 GC Park North. We're asking for that sign to be relocated. about 40 ft west. Right now it is east east right now is to the left or west of the fire hydrant. And it is creates a confusing situation where people believe they can park in front of the the fire hydrant. So we're asking for it to be moved outside of the fire hydrant. No parking area parking in front of the building in front of the fire. Okay, if there's no objection. Oh, I'm sorry. Sandre Lop has her hand raised. Sandra, I thought some ways it said they wanted to make the no parking 30 feet. Did I get that right? It wasn't just about the fire hydrant, but it was having a fairly decent amount of space. They originally gave the to the committee there was their main concern was asking for to make it clear that there's no parking allowed in front of the prior there was originally a request for signage no parking signage when they came to the committee but after discussing with with the at committee they didn't feel that no parking signage was appropriate and we reached a compromise of moving the existing fine that as parking regulations to better clarify the parking situation for the parking. So, it's just about the no parking sign. It's not about increasing the the space. That's all I'm asking. yeah, this general sign. It wouldn't change anything with the Okay. We do have the next resolution though does pertain to some parking regulation changes. That's unrelated to this one. Okay. But just my comment is all we keep doing is losing public parking space and that's very problematic because the cost of not having that for the middle class is a disaster. So that's my comment. Okay. oh, I'm sorry, Larry. Just encouraging in reading this summary and listening. just a tad confused. So, we are describing the area in front of the fire hybrid and what parking regulation is applicable there. so so the the current sign I forget exactly what it says. It I believe it designates the street cleaning hours and the meter parking. So we're asking for that time to be moved to the other side of the the hydrant. So that's not confusing that people believe that they can that that area in front of the parking sorry the area in front of the hydrant is subject to those the open hours and the regulations. Okay. So I think we need to be I think we need to be clear that the parking regulation in front of a fire hydrant is no standing no barking and 15 ft on either side of the fire hydrant. Yeah. Okay. if there's no objection, we'll now vote on the resolution. Please mark your ballots. so the next resolution we have is in pertains to the same block, same corner but slightly different issue. so the residents of the neighborhood have been coming to the last two transportation committee meetings to express concerns they've had around construction at 38 Grand Park North and concerned with congestion and not a vehicle. So we'll be blocking potentially blocking the roadway and I have been blocking the roadway related to the demolition and forthcoming reconstruction of 38 RC park north. in order to move out their concerns about traffic on that corner, we, are recommending that the Department of Transportation temporarily, restrict parking on the north side of that corner, to temporarily not allow parking, basically from that fire hydrant to the to the corner. It's approximately three parking spaces to allow for vehicle to be able to get through that that area while there's construction activity construction vehicles. Yeah. Isn't park or in that area old no standing? much of the block is the block that we're requesting to change does have meter parking there on the corner but west of those much of the pretty much the entire block is is no parking residents and I have observed that those signs are largely ignored by folks using parking placards primarily the NYPD precinct that's down the block. so while there's technically no parking on the block, it is almost always. So, so why boing there should be enforced signs not going to help because people not having ticket for instance or the department of transportation is not important parking. So whether you put more signs up, I don't think it can make any difference. Well, so just to be fair, there is parking. This is parking is allowed in this area where we're asking for it to be changed. No parking. It's near parking today. I share your concern that it will be ignored though. We try and it can't be enforced if if there's no signage indicating as such. Yeah. All right. Do we have any other questions on this? Okay. All right. If there's no Oh, I'm sorry. Jason. okay. If there's no objection, we'll now vote on the resolution. Please mark your digital ballot. And while you're doing that, I have a report. I am very excited that the Cleo Bridge statue path will be open on the roadway of the bridge on Sunday at 9:00 a.m. I will be there. walking across it. so this the committee and the board has advocating this for some time. It's been about three years in the making. So I'm excited to see this finally coming forward. although the city council has been considering a universal daylighting bill. this is effectively would restrict parking at intersections that there would be no parking lot within 20 ft of an intersection to increase visibility for pedestrians walk and make intersection safer. all of our city council representatives, council member powers and council member Rivera have sponsored this bill. There was a hearing a couple weeks ago at city hall on this that I was able to testify in support on behalf of the board given our recent resolution in support of that. also wanted to update on sending a note to the Department of Transportation to request seings and callers to be installed at the plaza in Fifth Bay at 2nd Avenue and 32nd Street. we recently met with the board from Kate Towers. They were in support of activating the phase. and so we've gone ahead and asked D to help make that space a bit more robust and usable. and then lastly, the committee is extremely excited that DOT is planning to present to us on a protected a protected bike lane on Third Avenue in our next month meeting and that will be covering the area from 59th Street South to 24th Street. all the funding at the airport. Great. Thank you. next we have Stu Desert, chair of public safety and sanitation. The first resolution I think we're not and just if if anyone would like to see any of the visuals that go along with the resolution, we do have them. But I thought in the spirit of the time we if there were any questions we might just proceed. Okay. If there's an objection, we'll now vote on the resolution. Please mark your ballot. And for the visuals, you can always watch the the zoom of the public safety and sanitation. There's some interesting images that that have been done. Hey, we have a second resolution on the agenda. at the time that the resolution on discovery was reported out of committee, the governor had been holding the state's budget in as a hostage in a quest for the legislature to make substantial changes to the law and evidence. after negotiations the governor lauded the changes but when the text of the legislation was released it was obvious that the legislature the legislature held firm and the amendments are quite modest to agree to agree then the language of the resolution was superseded by events. the committee might still want to support some complimentary legislation and and legislation that would help both district attorneys and defend council. and the committee might also want to voice a position should the governor's proposals revivify. So, madame chair, I seek unanimous consent to recommit the resolution to the public safety and sanitation committee. any objection? Are there any objections? Seeing none, please go ahead. Okay, for those of you regarding your ballots, just mark whatever for that resolution and we will strip it out later. All right. Next, we have business affairs and licensing. Anton Mhler is chair. Right. Bundle A, L, M, and N, which are all alteration, the S SOA or sidewalk dining. all the restaurants in question that comply with all the necessary paperwork. They do have sidewalk face but they do need to have this alteration licensing as we all know. And you may have a liquor license for selling wine, beer, cider inside, but as soon as you put up a an outside vending area, either on the sidewalk or on the Broadway, you have to get an operation license from the state liquor authority. we have no problems. These are all unanimously approved by members of the committee. And I would suggest that this is the best way to handle those particular alteration licenses. So just what were the ones again please? A A L N and N. Okay. And so for for the new members, we quite often do this. If it's something that's not contentious, we just bundle it and if there's no discussion, just go ahead and vote. I would like to also make resolution to bundle B through K which are halls that were have a license. We recommended approval in our voting. they all fill up appropriately the P requirements in terms of schematics and other questions regarding the distances from the curb and number of seats. We have no issues with that and they were all voted unanimously by the committee to be granted. Which one? Sorry, Kevin. Second parliamentary. so I second both. Okay. I'm sorry. All right. Then Pat, you had a question. Yeah. As a new member and clearly did not hear. I did look up the cafe policy. I'm just curious when we're saying bundling everything that is it a temporary situation or is it long term and it's such kind or that's something to be held at the next meeting. Well, Anton can explain. Yeah. Reason we ask for bonding is because all these nonentemptions, no problem. And they all refer to the same kind of approval. sidewalk cafe license or alteration license toward state authority. The sidewalk cafe licenses are recommendations for approval to the department of transportation which has perview over sidewalk cafes and roadway cafes. B through K are all sidewalk cafe licenses. All the appropriate documentation was sent to the DOT which does send it to us with unfortunately very little time to review them, but we do review them all and they're very comprehensive and it's the setup of what they were doing in the past when the pandemic hit us. These types of sidewalk licenses and roadway licenses are far more temporary and far more aesthetic to the neighborhood. So yes, this is a long-term license, but they have submitted documentation and if you're interested in the documentation, you can go back to the Zoom of the meeting and it is it is point of clarity I did. Okay. and it was the question about longevity, like how long is this long-term, how long is the license for? Four years. Four years. Thank you. Okay. I'd like to bundle OP, QR, and S together. These are applications for bigger licenses. We review them all and they're all unanimously approved by the committee members and they're all restaurants which we are with we are familiar with from the neighborhood. Okay, we have a second. All right, so please go ahead and mark your ballots now. D resolution of no comment regarding alteration for wine beer der incorporated during business the Ryan diner and grill situation came up that we had looked at this at not the last meeting prior meeting and found out that their liquor license had expired. So, we couldn't approve or recommend an alteration for an outdoor cafe license for selling liquor if they don't have an original license to begin with. We found out the same day that we were meeting that the state authority had granted them a liberal for their restaurant. since we didn't have enough time to really get into this, we felt that we didn't want to not give Orion Diner long time restaurant in the neighborhood a no comp resolution. So rather than approving, we send this no comment to safe liquor authority and again this was unanimous. we had no issues like the Orion diamond rule. The only problem is their license for the reason but the apparent oversight was allowed to lapse but is now in order and we would have no issue with alteration application. Larry clarification you mentioned that they received an approval for a full liquor license. Well, they already had one was last and between our let's see our March meeting and the special meeting we had yesterday, they were able to regularize that as of yesterday morning. And so as of this evening, they have a full liquor license. And this resolution the wine license to the full liquor license. This refers to the alteration. So required what are they what are they going to propose to operate on the sidewalk? their full liquor license. It's a wine license. I'm sorry. What was the question? In other words, a full on premises liquor license or is it a wine license? This is wine. Okay. And that's what's been approved, right? Okay. is there a possibility of a of a of an amendment so that we could be consistent with the status quo and support There's a there's a tight there's a tight timeline on that and we spoke with the SLA on this about whether they would what they think about this language. and they're perfectly fine with it. I'd be I'd be happy to move or support Larry. I don't think we need to. I think we can just proceed the way the committee has agreed to do it. Unless there's, you know, any particular benefit to that, I'm not sure there is. Anton, would you prefer to proceed? State authority paid. Okay, no problem. So, but it's not a concern. Okay. Thank you. Okay. The last one is a resolution objection for new application retail based for on premises liquor license for M4 Gy Park Hotel LLC and for Grammy Park Hotel Tenant LLC and MCR Property Management LLC DBA to be determined at two Lexington Avenue 52 Gy Park North Daer Lexington Avenue. I know we had a number of comments from members of the community. I also read all the letters that were sent to the office this afternoon after 3:00. I respectfully respectfully submit that we did our due diligence. I feel the hotel operator is a great operator. So did the committee. We had two members of the community representing that this would be a good thing for the community as a whole and the hotel operator appears to have done all due diligence in terms of sound and I'm not familiar with that area and quite frankly we might not consider Lexington Avenue a restaurant card or if you go to the other side of the park ing place. Every building has a restaurant. So, I'm a little concerned that residents feel that this would change the character of the neighborhood. I know that the the National Art Club has more than 150 events every year in which there are people coming in and out the sea park south. So I feel felt that the hotel in addition to the neighborhood and that they would operate under the current laws of the state labor authority and do which by the way has the purview over sidewalk and roadway cafe of the SLA. Any questions? Just see. Yes. I'd like to speak to that rooftop bar. It I I live on Grammarly Park and I live with that for years. It was a horror. I cannot tell you. I could not believe this at this meeting. It might come up again. I guess over co it was gone. It was an ongoing horror every weekend. the disregard for the community, the way it disrupted our lives, the noise. You can't have an open bar and think there's no noise. I couldn't believe how far the noise traveled. 311 didn't do anything. Nothing did anything. We live with that. The thought of it returning is a horror. These community members showed up because they have lived with it. I live with it. And all I could say, it was an unbearable experience. The arrogance, the sense that this is a commercial district, which it is not. The sense that nobody cared about the residents, the sense that you had kids, the noise started, it went on. The thought of it going till 4:00 a.m. 11:00 a.m. it was 11:00 p.m. It was unbearable. But that would be all I can tell you, it was a disgrace. An absolute disgrace. So to make that parallel to the you know the the you know the national arts club irrelevant it's an irrelevant comparison the all the places on Irving nobody violated the privacy the respect for the neighborhood the way that hotel did it would be unbearable if we talking about prior owner of the hotel not the current owner I understand that but you know you give people a license and You hand away power that you cannot believe and noise travels and that that or whatever the music was, they were blasting it. These folks who spoke knew what they were talking about to suggest we now have godsend. You know, I'm a little bit cynical when it comes to that kind of, you know, commercialization. Go make people accountable once you've signed it away. It's an interesting dilemma. Okay. I can only tell you what 311 did, which is nothing. either of your comments. Well, I wanted to we you know, we spent a lot of time handling this application and I was under the impression I think most of us were that it was we addressed the issue of noise. So, we we talked about it probably for 20 30 minutes. the impression that I got was that in the past it had been a concern. but there were going to I'm pretty sure that we you know we discussed the fact that we that the noise would be limited. Yes. So and also I I just what's your control mechanism? Not to be cynical. How do you control it once you start it? Cassandra please wait till you I know. I'm sorry. Thank you wants to go. Yeah. While a rooftop bar is open, there's also an enclosed area that that covers the rooftop bar. Okay. So, I'm going to go on the record again. I didn't think I had to this week, but here we are. There's issues around these licenses that were running through committees, and I know you guys are doing a it's a hard job. There's a lot of things you have to do, but I heard from a lot of folks today. I'd like to think I'm listening to the community and it seems this rooftop bar is a big part of this. Can't we go back and talk to these people again and bring these people in? Let's have a conversation because we're just alienating an entire neighborhood to an establishment that could actually and they have admitted could be very good for their neighborhood. So to me, it's more how we're doing stuff. Maybe not how it ends, but anyone who's even walked past a rooftop bar, come up, knows what that means. So I'm just on the record that I think there's an issue with this resolution. I think we need to hold off, get more conversation, bring in the owners, have a meeting. Let's get a win. So everyone feels good about this project. That's how things get done and that's how things are successful. So that's me on the record. Is Mr. Bernstein still Bernstein? I'm I'm sorry I didn't attorney. Donald attorney. Yes. He's here. What? I don't think he's He's here. He is here. Keith, do you Kevin? Yes, I'm here. Sorry, Kevin has his hand up, please. Thank you. The word relevance was mentioned. What is relevant and I know that the committee knows this is the Freehand Hotel. They have a open air bar restaurant. They serve drinks to a certain hour. We went down this road before where we made sure that the noise was mitigated. We know we heard from somebody who lived right across the street. So I think there's a case study here to pretend this is the first rooftop top bar. Not only is it not the first, the other one is what four blocks off Lexington. Can we address that Anton? Because again there's a lot of due diligence and discussion went around and I believe they're now in a happy space there. Thank you. Anton. Well, I thought the sound report that was made by this expert lay out very clearly that the sounds that coming from this rooftop bar were about or less than the ambient noise of the street. So, I'm a little confused as to we shouldn't conflate what happened four blocks away with what's happening over here, what happened five years in the past. I I think what Kevin's saying is that we actually dealt with a situation where there were complaints and managed to have it be acceptable to the community. and and the the providers did set up sound barriers did give u thought to not playing music after a certain time and we didn't have any issues for years to do that. Sorry, we're in discussion up here. Steve, do you want to say something? When I heard the speakers tonight on on both sides, I thought that they were willing to have a dialogue that they didn't yet feel they had. I would like to make a motion, but Anton, I'm going to ask you to comment on this first. I would like to move to recommmit this to your committee and to let all the parties communicate each other. And all right, I seem to feel again from the letters I seen over here that it only emanates from one or two buildings around there, not the rest of the neighborhood. And I I'm sorry, two Lexington, seven Lexington are the primary I received and may please if we could just have one pass away. Okay. All right. I would like to recommend that we ask for a discussion between the community and the the hotel owner. And I understand that the next bulk meeting has an extremely long agenda. So we don't necessarily want to burden them, but if there can be this meeting and I know that I'm pretty sure that the the owner of the hotel is willing to speak with the community, they have done that. So we can ask them to meet with the community and come back just have a a brief review of this at your next meeting. Right. And you're right. The owner did meet with So let him meet with let them meet with the rest of the community. I just want to add some procedural information as the former business of chair business affairs chair when all these issues originally were being dled about 10 years ago. and you know coincided with COVID when finally shut down. So this area has been closed for about six years now almost. a vote tonight doesn't automatically give the license to be out. There's still a form where the city council has to vote on it. So, I think we have enough information tonight to actually vote on this and can have the stipulation. I think Mr. Let me let me finish listen to you. I didn't say anything. Let me finish my thought, please. Where we can take the vote on it with the information that has been prevented. If you want to say no, say no. If you want to say yes, say yes. But we can ask for a stipulation. Mr. Bernstein is here as well that any positive vote has to include consistent dialogue with the residents, not a one-off, consistent dialogue with the residents. And I agree with Kevin, we've had this issue in the past where we've actually gotten it to a place where people in the city brought it back. so I think we have the ability to do that. I think the vote that we take tonight does not preclude a meeting between the residents and the business operator themselves. You can have that independently. You can you can we can have that be a stipulation in this resolution as well. So if you are committed to that, if you as you have mentioned that you want to have that conversation, we can stipulate that right now and vote it in the affirmative to make sure that if they do not meet with you, if they do not have that, then that resolution is voided. So I would suggest that half in order to make sure that it's accountable to everyone and that everyone's interest is being represented. And can I ask a question? I'm sorry this is just for board members. Oh, are you a board member? Sorry, I didn't mess up. I thought I was a mean. I'm sorry about that, but having done this for many years, that's useless because unless you have them before you make the vote, nothing is going to happen. Even if they do meet So the teeth is if they they come bring it back. I know you guys are all busy. Put it on on actually do what they ask cuz I thought you know I think that makes sense from a newbie perspective that's done this for 40 years. The only way to get a real vote and a voice from us to the city council is if we understand the real issues and that they do it. I don't think they understand the real issues yet because they're not communicating to the ne the whole neighborhood and even if it's a block away that doesn't matter. That's just my my question. You're not supposed to shut up, but so let we'll let Kyle respond just No. So I totally understand. and I'm just kind of giving a little example of you know being the business and the chair of the board previously too about how strategically that we can do this to make sure that it actually moves forward in an appropriate way. but I think also at the root of this too, and you know, this has been mentioned before, is that we can't hold applicants to the sins of former operators. I think that's a big big issue here is that a lot of these issues are with a former applicant, a former operator and to set a precedent. But let me finish, sir. Sir, sir, let me finish. Let me finish. Thank you. Please. This is a discussion for the community board. Thank you. Is that a precedent where we're holding new applicants who have had nothing to do with the issues that you've experienced? And I'm not saying that your issues have not been experienced. I think we have all recognized that and we prioritize that in this resolution and with this new applicant and we're willing to put it in writing that this needs to be proactive, this needs to be preventative and it needs to go forward in a way that is responsible to the community. But the root of a lot of these comments are because of the previous operator. And to set a precedent, we're holding new businesses in an area when we're talking about empty storefronts, vacant buildings, and why aren't they being filled up? It's for reasons like this where we get good operators. This operator has operated a bunch of hotels in this district, topnotch hotels, and have shown and have shown that they do that. Excuse me, please. I'm a board members. and so and so that's you know if we have to we'll empty the room. Please let us let us have our discussion. And so I would just urge the board members to keep that in mind that while there are issues that exist is not with this applicant who's before us who has committed to not committing misers. And if I could just recommend that we have a motion on the floor to alter the the resolution. I will second Pal's motion. Okay. And then we need to vote on that and then I think after that we will vote on sending it back to committee. I'm sorry to interrupt but I keep raising my hand and I think you don't see it. We do see it. We've got lots of hands raised but we're going to move ahead with a vote on whether we are going to alter the existing resolution or not. Okay. So let's I think unfortunately we if we can do a show of hands that's the easiest. If it's close we'll The amendment. The amendment is to alter the existing resolution to include a stipulation that the owner must meet with the residents prior to the vote by the city council. Why can't we table this? I'm sorry. At this point, this degree, we've already we've had we've had this motion presented. will if this does not pass we will vote on tableabling or not tableabling but sending back to the committee. Can I ask what city council is is vote is there? This is a state liquor license. So the city council has no role in this. So the city council gives approval don't they don't they vote for dining out NYC applications but this is a pure state. This is a pure liquor license. So the city council is not going to weigh on this. Okay. So let's let's go back. let's vote on whether we'd like to have this sent back to committee and have a dis a discussion with the community and the and the operator potentially. we could arrange it, but it does not have to be at our committee meeting and we make sure that happens and we will vote on this at the next meeting. So, do we have a second for that? Okay, I second to send it back. All right. So, if we could have a show of hands, all those in favor of sending it back of sending it back and to have a discussion, okay, with the committee, with the operator prior to coming back to our committee, I just I just wanted to clarify this. Okay. What we're holding on now is to do what? send it back to the committee send or that the operator will be required to meet with the community and then come back to the committee. We are sending it back to the committee with the stipulation that the operator will have a meeting with the with the community prior to our meeting because it's not going to happen in the committee because we just we've already done that. Okay, we're clear on what we're voting on. All right. Do we need a Do we need a roll call? Is it too close? It would be easier to do it would be better to do the roll call. Okay, let's go for the roll call. Okay, I will call the names. in favor, opposed. abstain. Tanya Aras. In favor of turning back to committee. Okay. In favor means you wanted to go back to committee. Opposed mean you wanted to stay here to vote to vote on. Kyle Thigh opposed on a vote. Okay. Neil Barkley. Neil, you're muted. Yeah. Yep. Got it. Okay. Yeah. In favor of sending it back to committee and just say in favor. Keep it short. Marty Barrett opposed. Okay. Ellie Barroso opposed. Okay. Daniel Bernstein opposed. Okay. Liz Burr opposed. Okay. Jim Collins is not here. Stu Desesser favor. Okay. B. Disman is not here. Maya Donahghue. Okay. Robert Bartan. He's not here. Barack Freriedman opposed. Okay. Jason Fromawitz opposed. Okay. Eric Goldberg. Okay. Justin Goldberg opposed. Okay. Gloria Hage. In favor. Okay. Rabia is not here. Paige judge opposed. Okay. John Keller opposed. Okay. Rupal Kakad not here. Not here. Kate Kennedy. Okay. Nadim Khani is not here. Katie Lando in favor. Okay. Sandre Ltoff in favor. Okay. David Levy not here. Not here. Anton Melner opposed. Okay. Sandy McKe in favor. Okay. Alec Militec opposed. Okay. Rich Mintz, are you here? No, I don't see you. Kevin O'Keefe opposed. Okay. Rashma Patel in favor. Okay. Steve Perez in favor. Okay. Will Perry. Okay. Omar Careshi is not here. Marryiam Ralph in favor. Okay. Michael Anroe, are you here? Not here. Okay. Not here. Larry Sh opposed. Okay. And Seligman, not here. Not here. Sandra Sherrod in favor. All right. Mubin Sadiki in favor. Okay. Letty Simon in favor. Okay. Mark Thompson in favor. Okay. Gabe Tzo. Okay. Cat Valero in favor. Okay. James Vera in favor. Okay. Jerry Weinstein opposed. Okay. Sarah Whittington. Okay. David Woods. Okay. Shuya Zho. Okay. Let me tally these up. comparing with you. What is this? It's a tie. No. Let's see. Sounded like a tie. All right. Nearly 20 members voted to send it back. 19 voted to keep it here. So it goes back by the skin of our team. But but let's be clear, it's not this discussion is not happening at the bulk committee. It must happen outside of that committee. They've spent a lot of time heard a lot of comments already. I don't think we we want to do that. So we will try we can organize a meeting. okay. Yeah we can organize a meeting. yeah the current agenda of the next bulk committee meeting is looking at 35 plus items. So unless you guys want to be there for like five hours. It's probably better to do this in a separate session. And Justin wanted to Yeah. I just wanted to say one thing which is these bald meetings you know we we spent almost three or four hours every month in these this specific issue we probably we spent a long time with it. firstly those these meetings are always open for anybody to come to. So people should and including board members here should be coming to these and you know not necessarily having such a strong opinion 3 weeks later if they haven't reviewed it and I you know Anton I just want to give respect to you that you know these meetings run so smoothly they're three and a half hours four hours long and I just want to express appreciation for you and I think the assumption is that this will come back in favor because we understand that it can worked out. It's not an, you know, we're probably not going to change our opinion about this particular issue, but we understand that there should be a dialogue. Whether it happens before or after, I think it's really the issue. I have this point is because the meeting was put up on our website. There was also a sign very clear front door toward the hotel with the dot and other signs that this meeting graffit that particular date and that me community were invited to make their comments. There were only two members of the committee that showed up. Understood. So, let's move on to our next our next resolutions. Oh, I'm sorry, Sarah. To that being Sarah Wington, W committee member. I also want to echo what my members of the committee, the co- members of the committee have said. We spent a lot of time with this and it was an issue that we we talked about and the point I would like to make to our community is yes we are listening but you need to come to us and how you do that is to go online look at what the agendas are be in your community and talk with other people and that would have been helpful of course this is 2020 hindsight but on the other hand, we have responsibilities to take care of and as community members, we should know what's going on with our community boards and all of these committees. All right, members, on your ballot for this item, mark whatever you want. We'll strip it out when we get back to the office. Okay, Anton, your last resolution. [Music] meeting and vice versa. Contact the community board, please. Contact the community board. We'll reach out to the operators and try and find a date that works for them and then we will let you all know what we can arrange. parks. That would be much appreciated. Thank you. as we all know, we've been having issues with the office of management where they run their business and some of our most contentious meetings the bulk have do with cannabis licenses. What the cannabis management under the public conveyance is to reduce the distance between capitalist establishments from thousand ft current regulations to 500 ft. Yep. been a lot of push back in the community about having legal kind of shops in our community. Never mind having cannabis shops that are less than 5 500 ft away. So we felt as a committee in order to limit the number of cannabis shops in our community a th00and ft radius rule should continue to be in effect and not be reduced to anything less. The other mission that is not here, I just want to raise it so that we're all aware that the rules regarding distance from houses of worship and schools seem to be put in the lines of the office can management and we will hopefully address this at one of our bulk meetings so that there's more clarity in terms of distance of cannabis dispensaries from schools. and houses of worship and other public conveniences. Are there any questions? If not, if there's no objection, we'll now vote on the resolution. Please mark your ballot. Do you have a report, Anton? Watch the website. That's opposing. [Music] Have you read the resolution? Then if you agree with it, you're in favor. If you disagree with it, you're opposed. Okay. moving on to budget and government affairs. I believe Stephen Perez is going to be leading this one. He's the vice chair. thank you Steve. So the first resolution is regarding preserving the tax exemption of municipal bonds. the capital requests that you see in our district need statement are funded through the city's capital program which is primarily funded through taxes and bonds. And in the federal budget reconciliation bill, there is discussion that they would get rid of that and that would increase the cost of borrowing for these capital projects that we have by up to 30%. It, you know, would range, but it could be as much as that. In the last time they had the tax bill in 2017, they got rid of our ability as a city to refinance our debt, which we used to be able to do. So now we're already doing that on a taxable basis. And in a recent deal that New York City did in April, they had a billion dollars of tax bonds which had a rate of 4.3% on 10 years and the tax book issue which is also billion dollar a week later had a 5.3%. So you're seeing almost 1% increase in cost there. so we wrote this resolution today. the house ways and means committee actually didn't include it in the reconciliation bill. That's the first step, but u we'll monitor it and we wrote this resolution. We're presenting it and we want to send it to our congressional. Are there any questions? If there's no objection, we'll vote on the resolution and please mark your ballots. Actually 5B just a second. Oh, I'm sorry. 5B. Yes. Sorry. I have I have to go. Okay. Certainly no problem.

So, 5A is simply a proforma. we every year we receive a city-wide statement of needs from the city basically saying about changes that are going to need public facilities across the the city. So it's just we have no objection to any of the changes that are coming. Okay, any questions? All right, seeing no questions, please vote on the resolution and you can now submit your ballot. all right, any report? Yes. Very quickly, it's very important. There are two charter revision commissions that have released interim reports. we are going to study them before our next meeting and we'll be discussing them at our next budget and government affairs meeting. and then the other thing that I wanted to mention is that we have received the responses from the OM in regards to all of our budget requests. So thank you Brendan for updating the air table. All all the updates have been made. So every committee should go there and look at the responses that you've received to the measurements and make any changes or dialogue. We engage with those city officials as needed. And Stephen will will anyone from the committee be making testimony at the next at the next charter meeting? So I wrote up testimony for you to submit. Yes. Okay. So because our tight deadline to submit testimony to the charter revision commission based on everything that we've already written up in resolutions and budget requests which included increased funding for community boards and having the city help the community boards find space for our public meetings. we wrote I wrote a testimony for Sandy to submit and that will be submitted this week. Thank you. Great. Tanya, I don't know if I was supposed to do this or not, but I stayed up till 2 o'clock in the morning in Germany watching that land use charter commission and and I didn't submit it, you know, testimony as a as a person to it because it was interesting to watch. We submitted testimony to the mayor's charter revision. Gabes presented it. So, as a board, we we've done that. so definitely participate as the public please. youth and education we go real quick. Yeah. we held a meeting we passed a budget request and committee will continue to meet later this month. Thank you. Okay. Parks and cultural affairs Neil. Hello. hello. So we had no meeting in May and then we would just say this weekend coming up will be it's my park day. So throughout the district all the different parks on Saturday you can go and volunteer. On Sunday we'll be in the east park of Stson Square Park if you'd like to volunteer. All right. Thanks everyone. I don't I don't know the gentleman who presented earlier about Green Street here. Yes. is but Neil I believe you said that you could not request a resident could request trees and I remember filing an application online with the department of parks to request trees on a street are you familiar with that yeah you can go online and request a tree and I would just say the it's a process but yeah you can go ahead and you can request I mean you can't there's a drop there's a drop down but then it's like grayed out and says you can't test yeah they actually have stopped that process. Okay. So that's they're talking about an urban forest but in our district we have to locate trees in other places besides on the street. So that's one of the things that it's one of the things that I think the parks committee is going to be talking about in the future. anything else, Neil? Okay, we'll move on to housing and homelessness and sorry, Larry. Neil, on the in the East Park status square, the fountain hasn't been running for several years. Do you have an update on that? Say that. Say that one more time. East Park, Stson Square Fountain has not been operating for several years. Yeah, Fountain is operating. Yeah. So, I I know there are there's some issues with water there and we will talk about that in June. We're going to just talk about the different parks in the district that have water and that need water. but that that's been some that's been a problem for a little while. you know, we can ask we can ask the parks department if they have an update on that or at least see what the the status is of where it is. Okay. housing and homelessness. we have a bit of a change in this committee. Rich has decided he's going to step down. He's been a great chair for a long time and he's passing on the baton. so Alec Militech is going to be our new chair and Sandra Leto is our vice chair. So yes, we're already sharing the committee. It appates my time on board. So thank you Rich. I'll keep it short.

Thanks. Yeah, Rich was Rich was at the the pet ER today. He said, so hopefully it went well. health and environment ovaros. good evening everyone. So in our meeting last week, we had the harness expertise of licensed professional act, which is a new bill that expands the categories of mental health professionals who can conduct clinical examinations and make decisions about involuntary mental health treatment. The bill defines two new categories of professionals. The qualified clinical examiners which include psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychologists and clinical social workers. And the other categories of professionals include the previous group plus additional newly defined professionals who can make critical clinical decisions for involuntary hospitalization and perform various functions previously restricted to physicians. We also had a presentation by a doctor from NYU Longon Health on stroke awareness, signs of stroke and what to expect in the emergency department and treatment of stroke. And we also started discussion on how to bring new healthc care facilities in our district. And one possibility is having a micro hospital which is a short-term acute care hospital that focus directly on community needs and operate with within a compact clinical and administration framework. basically to address community needs in our area where patients may have overcrowded options for acute or emergency care at hospitals in in our community because of the MSBI closure. And in relation to this topic, Brad Korn will come in our June health and environmental committee meeting to describe what health services will be available for our community. now that MSBI has closed. So, please come to our meeting in June. Thank you. And just to clarify, Brad Korn is from Mount Sane Beth Israel. He's been our liaison previously. Great. Thank you.
