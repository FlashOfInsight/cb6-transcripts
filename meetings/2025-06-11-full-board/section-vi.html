The elected officials have sent their reports ahead of time and you can find them on the CB6 website. They can be found in the chat on Zoom or on the board's website page for full board meetings. I've asked our elected officials to be brief or wave their reports this evening due to the large number of people who have signed up to speak in the public session this evening. But first up, we have Arfan Karim from Belleview Hospital. He is Belleview Hospital's chief clinical officer here to talk us about what's happening at Belleview. Microphones I guess over there. Is it working or you can come here? Come here. This is Thank you for having me for the chief operations officer at New York City Health and Hospitals Belleview. I am excited to come talk to you about updates about our hospital which is just across the street or across the room fair that's here. and I wanted to let you know that Belleview is doing well and we are u here for the community here for every one of you and everyone in our community who serve it. As you probably already know Belleview is the oldest municipal hospital in the country that actually predates the country. We're celebrating our 289th year founded in 1736. And as you know, we've been through fever. we've been through the HIV epidemic. We've been through significantly other special pathogens including Ebola where we had the only patient who walked out of the building almost 10 years ago now Dr. Craig Spencer and most recently CO 19. we serve the community and the city valiantly in in trying to protect and that legacy continues today, right? Belle is here and Bellev will be here 300 and more years, right, to serve the community and to make sure that we're the beacon when there's time of need. few updates from the last several months. as you might not know, we celebrated nurses week. we celebrate all of our wonderful nurses who take care of the patients day in day out. and that was special cuz, you know, it's a way to recognize our nurses. It's a way to build a community and to make sure that the heart of our service is the wellness factor is taking into effect. we celebrated our children's author who donated our painter that donated works of art and it to make the space more lively and to make sure that our anger's patients are taking care of you know with provided with color and comfort and joy that they deserve. And then throughout May we we celebrated or we recognized breast cancer awareness month and we organized series of mamograph signup events throughout Mother's Day. they were designed to encourage staff and community members to prioritize with their help through early detection and preventive u measures. you also probably know we're the only level one trauma center below 68th Street, right? But whenever there is an emergency or trauma or things that happen, those patients usually come to Belleview. that included the ship that had an accident, right? recently the Mexican consulate we took care of all patients from that event at Belleview our staff was there for them and we made sure that everybody's taken care of few things that I want to talk about that is important in continuing this legacy and to make sure that we take care of our patients. The first is, as you probably know, there is a bill that passed in Congress that might cut Medicaid dollars significantly and that will have a significant impact not only Belleview but rest of health and hospitals and safety net system throughout the country. it is something that we're very much u observing and worried about because 70% of our patients are Medicaid patients, right? we're here for everyone that comes through the door. We take care of every single patient irrespective of the ability to pay and we will continue to do so. But this makes it harder. So we encourage community members to reach out to the electeds to other community members. Build awareness of how important Medicaid and Medicare is to the health system and how important it is for those services to remain at the current level if not increase. Right. definitely a cut is not warranted. from a personal level I can tell you so I I'm a first generation immigrant. I grew up in Queens in Sunnyside Queens across the river. and my family was served by health and hospitals. I went to Almer my whole life, right? My parents still get care there. and you know at different points my parents had multiple jobs. They juggled different things and health and hospitals was there and Medicaid and Medicaid like programs is what helped us get through and for me to be successful. so health care is a human right. Health care is something that's a necessity and it's an economic engine for everyone, right? it allows people to work, allows for them to be healthy and be productive in the community. And without Medicaid and without health awareness and health availability, it's going to be very difficult. So, I encourage everyone to continue to challenge that bill that's out there. there's still time. It only passed one side of Congress. it still needs to go through Senate and everything else. So, please definitely ensure that you're doing everything you can to help L's sustain itself, right? And help the hospital sustain itself. The last thing I wanted to talk about and I know everyone's interested in it. So, recently in our community, a hospital closed down right on Israel. and we at Belleview, you know, responded swiftly and effectively to deploy Israel. we took proactive measures to expand that capacity and safe continued care for our community. so we we made sure we're there just like we've been there. We'll always be there and we're ready to take care of the patients. you know, it's the timing was helpful in some ways. It's a coincidence that there was a slight change in FDY ambulance run. So there was a slight decrease in that week that on Saturday night that Israel closed. and so it allowed us to kind of understand the flow and get ourselves up to speed. but quickly once that was fixed or changed the volume returned to more the baseline we are seeing additional EMS runs. We're also seeing you know market increase in walk-in patients as expected right patients are coming for their care the demand has contributed to higher admission rates so more people are coming into our acute hospital and the inpatient units we also see increase in our psychiatric emergency department right the CPAP program has seen extra patients come in the third things that we are monitoring because those admissions leads to, you know, more patients in house. That means we need we need to make sure that we're doing our part to be efficient, but at the same time, we continue to grow and meet the demands of of the community. so we're we're we're really working hard at Belleview and working smart to make sure that we're able to address all needs, right? one example of a need, you know, heart attacks and strokes, we hear about this all all the time, right? particularly when it comes to strokes time is everything. Every second, every minute counts. as you probably know. So when a patient is brought to our emergency department, we have to act very quickly. and in stroke care, radiology equipment is very important because you want to know where exactly the stroke is what's happening and you want to get that done quickly. so as a as those events happen you know our equipment being up todate is equally important and so we're encouraging you know and advocating for those equipments right up making those equipments up to date. Some of our equipments are 20 years old when the life cycle might be 7 to 10 years right their end of life. we want to replace them with more modern equipment. We want to increase our capacity to do more exams and we want to be able to treat our patients right in the case of a stroke with using those equipments. these are called single plane and biplane. They're technical things but essentially a physician could go in and take out that clock, right? Clog like it's like unclogging your drain, right? they go plumbing and that literally leads to our patients walking out the door, right? somebody who might be incapacitated will not be because of these tools. So we are definitely encouraging our electeds as well as our community to advocate for those end of life equipment to be built so that we could continue to treat our patients. and then we're continually working in our ED and other areas within the budget that we have with the agreement we have with Mount Sinai to make sure that we're using our public dollars effectively, right? and prudently. we will increase our CT capacity in the ED. we're we're also working on making sure the flow is adequate and it's going through. That's essentially my update for Belleview. and happy to take questions if we're really hoping we don't have any questions this evening. We do have a health committee that I'm happy to have people attend. It meets tomorrow night, but thank you very much. We we really want to know what's happening in our community and please come to come visit us. we have a wonderful campus. You don't have to just come from medical care. You have to come in. We we have lots of architecture. at the old building, but you know, you never know if you have to go there. So, just come chance and take a look and then if you ever need medical care, I promise you we're going to give you top-notch care. I just have to say thank you for the immunizations. I really appreciate it. Those are the really important preventive care is the number one way of not going to be for emergency payment, right? That's another thing to advocate for in these times where you know that's under attack, but we're here and we'll always be here. Thank you again. Thank you very much. so next up we have Assembly Member Harvey Estee. He's on Zoom this evening. Yes, Andy. Here I am on Zoom. We're still in Albany. So, you know, we have about five days left in the legislative session. So, but I wanted to just quickly I know you guys got a long meeting in my in my monthly report. We spent a lot of time talking about the budget that we passed last month. Even though it was late, we did pass. There's a lot of good things in that, you know, talking about funding issues. We care about things that we were fighting for like the housing access voucher program, which is basically state-based section 8 program. talking about Maloneyy for abortion training to get more doctors trained. You know, a lot of things about funding, a lot of Maloneyy for public safety and mental health, trying to create a new 911 system across the state like Rochester has what's called Daniel's law. Really trying to talk about the issues that are affecting all of us in New York City around public safety, mental health, and affordable housing. Not to mention, we did around arts and cultures, environmental Maloneyy, and a lot of Maloneyy going back to individuals in New York. a lot of bills that people at some other time you want to talk to me about legislation that we're doing a lot. We we have a shredding event with Senator Gonzalez and I July one if people want to shred. We just had one last week but on my district office we're doing this one in in Sty Park neighbors associations co-sponsoring it. If you want to come down obviously everyone needs to shred including me. it's really important and just really if people have things that they want to get done before the legislative session the Senate is leaving tomorrow. We are here probably till Tuesday for the last moment. things that we're trying to get done like reducing waste and extended producing responsibility, talking about the New York Heat Act. They're trying to get some really important environmental bills done as well as we're doing a whole package on people know about the death of Robert Brooks and we're doing a package of bills around criminal justice reform. I'm attending my community board meeting and we hear you. So that's Larry, we hear you. so you know please do reach out. I know you got a bill packed meeting. I know Sandy doesn't want anyone to ask any questions but I'm happy to talk to you or send me an email or if you're really dying to ask me a question. I'm sure Sandy might let you. But if not, you know, I'm I'm available when you want to talk. Great. Thank you. we will we will take questions after after after if anybody has them. But thank you very much. All right, everyone. I'm going back to the legislative session. Thank you. Take care. Byebye. next up we have Payton Schultice from Kenn Senator Gonzalez's office. Hi. Hi. I have anything to add to my report. I'll take any questions, but I'll leave that up to you. Great. Thank you. Next, please have Wendy Brennan from Senator Krueger's office. Hey, I just wanted to announce that I'm taking over CB6 from Justin and I know you have a long agenda and I will come in person the next time and hope to get to meet some of the board members. Thank you. Bye. Great. Thank you. And say goodbye to Justin for us. He's been great. next we'll have Brocca Rosenberg from BP Lavine's office. Burough President Lavine. Hi. I'll just say read my report. don't want to take up any more time. Great. we have a question for you from Jason. Oh, I'll take that. Thank you. this evening we're going to be talking about a busway on 34th Street. I understand there was a some communication relayed from the Burough President's Office about about that about the third opinion on the 34th Street bus. Yeah, I believe there was a letter together with Keith P's office. so I I I mean I would defer to them because they took the lead on that. but we we were on board as well in support of the bus way. Okay. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Okay. Michael Anne, you have a question. yeah, I was going to ask a question too about the 34th Street busway. and like it's interesting how you queued that up, Jason. where was there a survey? Do you have a survey to to provide for us of of community engagement on such a massive project? I don't have that for you. but I I will I will also defer perhaps Keith P's office can speak more to the community engagement piece. I or or someone from our policy team I can I can look back on to that as well. Yeah. Because the community doesn't Thank you. Okay. Okay. next we're going on to any other questions? No. Community board. David Lawrence. What is your question for the Burough President's Office? Yes. If if Miss Rosenberg can ensure that the Burough President has access to all relevant traffic data concerning that proposal. yes. I mean, I believe our transportation policy analyst is is very on top of all of that. Okay. Because when we had the meeting the other week, DOT did not have that data. So, if you could follow I don't know exactly. Yes. I again I I would have to defer to the expert in my office, but I I will definitely check in with them. Okay. Thank you, Charlotte Fan. what is your question for the Burough President's Office? Charlotte fan. We will have Hello. it's Will and Charlotte. Hi. we we were just curious as to how the exit from the U tunnel would be diverted in the south direction. Overall, I think that I'm also in support of the bus way. I mean, I think I'm not sure that the burough president has the answer to that question. It's a little bit too detailed. Okay. Thank you, though. Okay. if there are no other questions, we'll move on to Robin, excuse me, Robin Forest from the mayor's office. Hi, everybody. I too will be brief. I want to make a quick announcement. the late Congressman Charlie Wrangle will be lying in state at city hall tomorrow between the hours of 9 and 5. The there's a viewing available to the public if anybody would like to attend. The funeral service is on Friday at St. Patrick's Cathedral. And with that, I'll talk more next time. Thank you. Thank you. Mackie Bentley, who is here in person from Congressman Nadler's office. Hello everyone. One thing from the board real quick. Congressman Nadler, state senator screw will be holding a town hall next Tuesday, June 17th from 6:00 to 7:30. They will be moderating special guest online. Thank you so much. And okay. And I believe David Lawrence, are you is your hand still raised or did you have a question a new question? Just for reasons for efficiency, could we just ask every representative of the elected officials, state as well as city, including the representative from the mayor's office to ensure that they have all relevant traffic data from the department of transportation covering this proposal and any analyses and assessment that's been done. and if there's a way to report back to the members of the community board what studies have been done and that there is data that has actually been assessed and fully assessed independently I think that would be very helpful. So rather than raise my hand each time if I can just make that request of every elected city state official. Thank you. Certainly we will make sure we we transmit that to them. Okay. after Maki, I'm sorry, Michael, did you have a question for Maki? Yeah, just real quick, what town hall meeting? What's the town hall meeting about? On the 17th town hall, just a general town hall in Hunter College. if there you can register online, Michael. Yes, you can register online. And so you have a question for Maki. Is it possible to increase the volume? the volume of me or the volume of as it goes. Okay. Hopefully that's better. next we have Emma Johnson from Council Member P's office. Hello everybody. my name is Emma. I am standing in for Pat this evening. He is out on vacation this week. So, I know there's a lot of questions about the the 34th Street bus. I think I I may not be the best person for it, but I am happy to take all of those questions back to the council member and to our chief of staff, Ben, and we can continue talking after the meeting. I will I'll skip a couple of the other things that I was going to talk about, but I did want to mention that we have a couple of events coming up. I want to make sure everyone's aware of. Number one, they're both on the same day. They're on June 21st. Number one is we're doing an adoption event co-sponsored with the Animal Care Centers of New York. That's going to be in Madison Square Park. That's 11:30 to 4:30. And then the same day, June 21st, we're also going to be doing a shred event and it's going to be right in your neighborhood, right at Sutton Place. So, it's in the little, culde-sac on East 57th Street and Set in Place. And that's going to be 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. So, again, those are on the same day, June 21st. So, I'll skip the rest of the everything else I had in my report, but I'm I'm happy to take questions back to the team about the 34th Street Bus because I know a lot of people have questions about that. Right. Okay. Thank you. Do we have any Yes. info. Does she have the info? Can we get it? Right. She said that they know the letter with the office but ours took the lead. So, do they And I think the question is from the from the audience here is do you have information on the on the data for the busway? I don't have data that I can share with you. I I think that would be coming from DOT, but I'm I'm happy to bring that back to the rest of the team and see what we can get for you. What do you have? Thank you. I'm sorry. Do we have a question here? Please, if you do raise your hand, I can't I can't. And if you could speak quite loudly so not a problem. Can you hear me? Said that they did a letter with powers and that they had the data. That's why they did the letter with powers. How come she's saying she doesn't have the data? I believe she's saying she's not the person with the data. So, I I I Yeah, like I like I mentioned, I I think Pat will know a little bit more about this than I do, but I I am happy to ask the rest of our team to get some of that data for you. I I think Are you asking specifically about a traffic study? I'm asking about everything to do with the bus. I want to know how many cars come in from each tunnel. I want to know where they go. I want to know how many express buses. I want to know how many Excuse me, ma'am. Please. We understand you'd like full data. Thank you. Thank you. All of it. All of it. Okay. We don't have it right now. So, unfortunately, wait until it's actually 34 Street bus before we speak about it. Yes, please. there's a gentleman back here who still has his hand up. about that data, miss last week, thieves said during this very issue that the data was incoming complete and not done yet and I was wondering if that data has since been completed and then you couldn't really talk about it because we seem complete. I don't believe this particular person was at that meeting. No, it's not. Okay. Thank you. We understand that you're looking for the data. We will ask for it and we can move on. Thank you. A quickie. I have a quickie. Just I just Okay. Yes. can you hear me? I just want to make sure you can hear. Yes, we can. Okay, great. I just wanted to check from the last meeting. I didn't catch how long have you been doing this research, looking for this data, trying to collect the data. Is that a question for me? Yes. so we I mean again this is data that would be coming from DOT. So our office is not conducting a study. so it's it's not something that I have been updated about a status of a a study or the data that you all are looking for. So I I'm I wish I had more to tell you. I don't know the status of it, but I'm I'm happy to ask Ben and Pat who you all know. Pat is back in the office next week. so I'm I'm happy to bring that to the both of them and see what I can get from them. And we'd like to move on, please. I see Mr. Lawrence has his hand raised again, but we do acknowledge your question and we will ask for that from all our elected officials. Thank you. So, who else do we have who's going to speak? Oh, Spencer from, Council Member Rivera's office. It's here in person. Everyone, good evening. I'm going to keep it super brief. Just want to highlight one upcoming event that our office has in our report. We have a nice little flyer here, too. it's on Saturday, June 21st. It's at 55th Avenue B, which is actually in the lot behind that building. So, if you have any confusion planning the event, go to Fourth Street and it's in the lot behind 55 Avenue B. It's a family day and job fair. We have a ton of organizations from the city coming to give out resources, identify job opportunities for members of the community. We'll have music, giveaways, food, etc. It should be a very fun event. It's from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday, June 21st. Again, and happy to take any questions. Great. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So, now we're now moving on to the public session. I'd like to let you know that 78 people have signed up to speak in this session. If everyone speaks for 3 minutes, we will be here for 4 hours. I suggest that we try and amalgamate some of your concerns and that if at all possible, if you see that the person in front of you mentions something that you agree with, you simply say you agree and we can move forward. We're going to do this based there are two fairly robust issues that we're going to deal with this evening. The first one is going to be the Grammarcy Park Hotel and we will have those people go first. But really we we would we need to vacate this room at a certain time. So we'd like you to respect all of the speakers and to make this as brief as possible. Okay. there's actually one speaker tonight that is not speaking on either of the items that you all are here for. So we will let them go first and then move on to Driver Hotel. They're the odd man out. okay. Robert Scott, you are here to speak. Are you here? All right. You are here to speak about the casino development. you have three minutes. You may begin now. Mr. Scott, your time is ticking. You're muted. You're muted. Yes. Please unmute yourself. We may have to. Yeah. See you your position. You don't want to go at the end. Believe me. Okay. and just one thing, once we call you to speak, the timer will start. Unfortunately, don't unmute yourself. you lose your three minutes. It's all counted as part of your three minutes. So, let's keep let's move on. Great. Hello. Okay. All right. Please go ahead. All right. Thank you. You have two minutes. I understand. Several of our neighbors have submitted a statement regarding the location of a casino next to the United Nations, a symbol for world peace and world communication, not gambling and all that is implied with it. There are other locations proposed for gambling. two of them already approved. So that they ought to be given priority and we urge that this location is simply not suited for the traffic, the automobile and other vehicular traffic that would be involved. So there are practical pragmatic reasons this is not a good location and there are symbolic reasons for our American democracy, a host to the United Nations, the nations of the world to not be symbolized by a casino. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. We actually have a resolution in place against having the casino located in this particular location. All right, we're moving on to the Gary Park Hotel. Okay. All right. The first of the on the list, Arlene Harrison, are you here, Arlene, or are you online? Yes, Arlene is online. Arlene, your time is ticking. Please proceed. And I'm president of the Grammy Park Block Association. The major focus of our work for the past 35 years has been working with over 40 neighborhood buildings in addressing their quality of life concerns. Therefore, we were most grateful to the leadership of a newly formed group of neighbors for reaching out to us with concerns involving the redevelopment of the Grammy Park Hotel. We met and are fully supportive of their commitment to working constructively with the developer to address and resolve their concerns. I believe we are all excited about the reopening of our beloved iconic hotel, which sadly has been shuttered for many years now, and we all want it to succeed. That being said, there are three elements in the current proposal that we all believe need to be addressed and resolved in a way that works for those who live here. One, sidewalk cafe. Two, basement speak easy. Three, rooftop bar. Sidewalk cafe. There is concern about the pro proposed size and hours of the sidewalk cafe. We understand any cafe will require a separate permit and public hearing and we plan to raise concerns and work with our neighbors to address them to address them when the time comes. Basement speak easy. A 4 a.m. liquor license and removable furniture understandably raise concerns about potential night lifestyle use. Current plans are now open-ended and we do not and do not preclude the use that could negatively impact on our neighbors. We strongly urge the developer to include stipulations in the liquor license that define a use consistent with a quiet luxury hotel in a residential neighborhood. Rooftop bar. The noise from the rooftop bar has for many years been a source of serious disruption to our neighbors and especially for our neighbors directly across the street. Past op operators blasted music late into the night harming residents quality of life in their own homes. We recommend a clear stipulation in the liquor license that the rooftop rollover should be closed by 1000 p.m. nightly. In conclusion, these concerns go to the core of what it means to live in this community. For decades, families have built their lives here with the expectation that the peaceful residential character of Grammar Park will be protected. The success of this project depends on whether our neighbors can continue to enjoy the quiet, safe community that we all have fought hard for to preserve. We stand firmly with our neighbors and believe these concerns must be fully addressed as essential conditions moving forward. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. Next on the list is Tyler Morse. Tyler, are you here? Please come up. Next on the list after that will be Vincent Perry and Valerie Valerie Foster. So get ready. Hi everybody. Thank you for coming out tonight. My name is Tyler Morse. I'm the developer of the Grand Park Hotel. we are thrilled to be bringing back an iconic building a Bing and Bing majestic building as a five-star hotel. this is not going to be a nightclub. That is not our intention. our intention is that our guests can sleep well at night and that you sleep well at night. because that makes me sleep well at night. That is the purpose of why we are here. we are we have gone out of our way over the past year and a half to work with the Grammy Park Block Association. We meet with them weekly on site about all kinds of different issues, construction, threat, waste, and we think we've kept a very clean community at our own cost. We put in an urban umbrella to make the sidewalk shed a lot better. Right? We are very interested in this community and we want to be a part of this community for a long time. we love the community. We are not here to create any problems. we have had many discussions as CD6 asked us to about a month ago with the neighborhood association with various neighbors. we heard your concerns. We listened to everything you had to say. we've made a lot of concessions. this may not be known to everybody, but we're happy to close the rollup cover at 11 p.m. on the top level of the building. one of the concerns was about setting up a community group so communication can transpire. We're happy to do that. we hired an acoustician at our expense who is the pre-Menint acoustician in New York City. we are going to follow all of the recommendations of the acoustical report on the sidewalk. we still have to get a department of transportation permit for to occupy the sidewalk. So we want to table that. There's going to be another bite at this apple on the sidewalk. and we have a dozen liquor licenses in New York City and across the country and we've never had issues. So, we think that our track record speaks for ourself. This is a five-star hotel. I'm not aware of a Four Seasons Hotel or Crosby Street Hotel or a Sur Hotel that's ever had alcohol violation issues. We are not creating a nightclub here. we are bringing back an iconic asset that is important to the community and we stand by the licensing committee and their unanimous approval of our license application about a month ago. Let me just repeat unanimous approval from community board 6 liquor licensing committee. we worked very hard at that. We worked with the community. we talked about every issue with that board. they're all here and we were very pleased to get that unanimous approval. So, thank you all for being here and thank you all for listening and we look forward to being part of the community. Thank you. All right, next on the list is Vincent Perry. Vincent Perry. Hi, my name is Vince Perry. I'm on the board of 60 Gishy Park North, otherwise known as 21st Street. I was going to talk about the the cafe outside, but I feel it totally necessary to address some of the comments from our last speaker. my knowledge and we we belong to the neighborhood working group which represents nine buildings in the community. All right. And that's over a thousand residents. None of us were informed at all either formally or by email about the development of the hotel. Not one communication with, as far as I know, R9 buildings. Okay. As far as the licensing committee of the the C6, the truth is that they voted down the application to go back and insist on the hotel to to enter into discussions with us. 20-19 was the vote. You can look at the meeting minutes of those meetings. as far as this neighborly claim that the hotel is going to be a good neighbor, they haven't they haven't sought any input from our community. they are the neighborhood is very pro hotel. We want the hotel. The hotel is not pro neighborhood. Neighbors should talk to the people surrounding them. All right. We call for a resolution of objection so that we can have the time, the due diligence that we have been denied to enter into discussions with a mutually satisfying resolution. Thank you very much. Thank you. Valerie Bostory, please come up. After that, it will be Sophie Prader and David Gain. All right, Miss Bostory, you have three minutes. Yeah, you do. My name is Valerie Bostory. I'm on the board for Lexington, next door to the hotel. first I'd like to thank the community board for listening to our concerns. and I want to ask you to pause and get liquor license for the NCR or any other further development. I come to you in three capacities. as a 30year 30 neighbor of the hotel or resident living there for 30 years as a board member for 16 years on the board. So I have a deep institutional knowledge of how the Grand Park Hotel has interacted with their neighbors and I have to agree with you sir that it has not been friendly. I also want to talk about our beautiful historic landmark neighborhood. has very narrow streets and sidewalks with no through streets. The traffic whether by foot or vehicle is very difficult. such a largecale commercial venue including Southern Nightclub, Rooftop Club until 400 a.m. and outdoor seating is not a safe environment for our neighborhood. My apartment faces the interior courtyard of the hotel. I've experienced firsthand the vibration, the noise, and the nonresponsiveness of the hotel management to turn the music down. They have soundproofed hotel rooms, but they have not soundproofed residents adjoining their bu their hotel. I also wanted to point out about the commercial again, the outdoor seating. We're on 23rd Street. The Department of Traffic has a sign up, no through traffic, because on many, many, many occasions, vehicles get jack knifed right on that corner. So, it is not a safe way to put tables and the noise level has not been addressed. I want to just maybe thank you again and ask you to please reconsider approving moving forward with any more development of the Grand Mercy Bar Hotel because they have not been communicating with their neighbors. the Grand Ry Park Association Harrison is not the only member. We are adjacent to that hotel and we have not been consulted in anything. And that seems like it's the same for 60 gram seed, seven less. Thank you. Thank you very much. We are commends. Next on the list, Sophie Prader Prader, are we here? David Gaines, Robin Sutenberg, you going? is Sophie here? If she is not here, we'll move on. Okay, let's move on. David Gaines, would you please wait for the microphone? Robin Suttonberg, are you here? Because you're next. Okay. My name is Dains. I'm a resident of 39y Park North in the entrance and some being covered. I'll reserve my comments about the rooftop bar and about the sidewalk cafe. I have been a resident in my building for 29 years. And I will say that 2 years after we moved in at an annual meeting of our building, I stood and asked our president anything could be done about the noise on Gary Park North and he said, "You'll get used to it. I'm still waiting." So, there we are. And now we have this project. I know that our developer says that this is not going to be a nightclub. But with 400 to 500 seats of entertainment and 200 rooms, the ratio of hospitality entertainment to rooms is enormous and it can't be viewed any other way. So I'll talk about traffic for just a moment. Traffic at the intersection is chronically heavy and often gridlocked. What is the plan for hundreds of vehicles needing access for drop off and standing zones all day and night? I'm not hearing anything about that. Residents already live with backups for blocks, blaring horns, cars routinely ignoring red lights at the corner and emergency vehicles that cannot pass and sound their sirens into the night. With this project in mind, a whole block of city bikes was installed directly across the street where a drop off zone might have been created. What forethought is being applied for an intersection that is already on overload? Please protect our quality of life and scale the project back. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. Robin Robin Suttonberg, you are next. Three minutes beginning now. I'm Rob Sber and I resigned at 39 Grand Park North for approximately 40 years. I am pleased that the Grand Park Hotel which has been an isore since it closing 5 years ago is reopening. However, my neighbors and I have concerns regarding the proposed public spaces. We are a quiet residential block and three floors of bars, a private club and especially outdoor seating are more than amenities to the hotel guests. These drinking establishments would significantly disturb the residential character of our neighborhood and present traffic safety and quality of life issues. My neighbors and I were unaware of the business affairs meeting which considered the hotel's liquor license. Had we known, we would have appeared to express our concerns and seek answers to the many questions we have which apparently were not addressed or considered at the initial business affairs meeting. For example, there are three entities applying for one Lego license for the premises. What are the relationships and responsibilities among these entities? Are they all operating all areas of the requested one license or are they each operating individual areas? Who do we complain to if there are problems? The plan shows sidewalk seating on the hotel perimeters on Lexington Avenue and Grid Park North designated as of right as within the lot lines of the hotel. Where are the lot lines? They were not included on the plans. what is the distance between the sidewalk seating and the curb? Will there be unobstructed pedestrian mobility? How did the license had license holders intend to mitigate their sidewalk cafe? Odors from food served outside brought in another testing station and where will the patrons stand while waiting for a table on the street? There's one lane of southbound traffic in front of the hotel on Lexington Avenue and one lane of traffic was found on Brady Cross Port. How does the hotel intend to handle cars, Ubers, and cabs, obstructing emergency vehicles and traffic on both streets while dropping off and picking up patrons? The plans indicate that threeth forest can accommodate over a thousand patrons, not including hotel guests. The largest application indicate no plans for security. Thank you. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list is Nancy Binham. Nancy Binham, I believe you're online. You have three minutes. You may begin now. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. yes. My name is Nancy Binham. I have been a resident at 60 Grammarcy Park North for 27 years. Thank you so much for allowing me to speak tonight. first I'd like to say that as close neighbors to the hotel, we're excited to see it come back to life, but there are a few elements of their plan that are of particular concern to me, my family, and my neighbors. first, I'd like to address the hotel's request for sidewalk dining and drinking on Lexington Avenue in Gramarcy Park North. I venture to say that all of us who have chosen to live on these quiet streets have done so in part because they form a peaceful oasis in the heart of one of the busiest neighborhoods in Manhattan. Sidewalk seating will fundamentally diminish the quality of life for those of us living here. The noise, the obstruction of the sidewalk by tables, chairs, waiters, and hundreds of customers. The general commotion and the trash that come with sidewalk seating would without a doubt have a material adverse impact on those of us living on these blocks. It will also surely exacerbate an already serious rat problem. to my knowledge, sidewalk seating has never been allowed at this location in the hotel's 100 plus year history. And the sidewalks are heavily used by families with strollers, senior citizens, dog walkers, and people with disabilities. There are two large sidewalk grates on Grammarly Park North. one placed closer to the building and the other closer to the street. That would force pedestrians either to walk on the grates, which if you're a dog walker, you know that's difficult, or be channeled onto narrow strips between the tables or along the edge. I strongly oppose sidewalk seating of any kind, shed or no shed, and of any capacity. Secondly, I understand that the current plan includes a rooftop club with live music, DJs, and service until 4 a.m., which I just don't think is appropriate for a residential area. I served on my building's board for 18 years, and I know from my time as a board member that the noise from the rooftop bar in the hotel's earlier incarnation represented a serious hardship to neighbors in my building whose apartments are adjacent to the hotel. I don't have an issue with the rooftop bar, per se, but I believe that it should operate in compliance with the city's noise code. which has a 10 10 p.m. curfew for outdoor spaces, not 11 p.m. as was stated by the owner. In conclusion, I ask that you consider a resolution of objection to this application tonight, taking into account the concerns of myself and the Grammar neighborhood. Thank you for your remarks. Next on the list, Orin. And I just might note we have 30 additional people who wish to speak on this topic. If anyone would like to consolidate their comments, we would greatly appreciate that. It's it is quite repetitive and I think you have to assume that people here do understand. We might take a show of hands. Who here is is against the the application as it stands? Who is against the application as it stands in our resolution? So, let's count. Yes. I'd like to see a show of hands of those people here who are against our resolution as it currently stands. This is just the public, please. Our members will vote later. So, could we please count? I hope someone else is counting. We'll do online next. 12 online. 12 online with hands raised. Yeah. Yeah. 12. All right. And in the moon 27. So actually one of you didn't sign up to speak because we have 38 more coming up. But I hope you understand that this is going to be an extremely lengthy meeting if we have to go through everyone's comments and they do tend to be repetitive. Is there someone who'd like to make a sort of general comment for the I have a question. Certainly ask for a show of hands of those in favor. I'm sorry. Yes, please. Let's have a show of hands for those in favor. Five. Five. Okay. What about online and online? community six. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight. Okay. So, we can keep continuing with with people's comments, but, I think it might in in the interest of time, it would be would be really helpful if we can move on. We are not voting on this until later in the evening. It will come up in our agenda. I think everyone saw the agenda. You have a separate point, not repeating whatever. If you're not repeating the previous points, I think that would be welcomed. Why don't we ask everyone just try to stick to one minute and not repeat? Still 38 minutes. I think it would be really helpful if we could consolidate, but we are a democracy. We'll certainly try and move forward. But I think we get I think everyone here sort of understands the positions. If you feel you have something that's to add to the conversation, please raise your hand and we'll let you speak. Can we ask someone who's in favor to speak? We've only heard Well, I think the people in favor have signed up. Oh, they have. Did you out online as well yet? Yes, we have. We have f We have a total of 13 in favor and 38 against. so, all right. If you'd like to make We have three additional people who want to speak, please come forward. I'll be very brief and I want to make a point that has not been addressed yet which is the question of the extent to what was the burn operator being tarnished by a sensor operator and I think it's very important to be clear that's not what's going on here. I'm perfectly willing to believe the good faith of the ground operator, but the the history says that the project is inherently problematic and especially the roof deck. It you know the code requires no unreasonable noise after 10 p.m. There's an offering. I believe that a chalice playing the cello suite solo at 10:05 p.m. with the roof open would constitute unreasonable noise. Like it would wake you up. There's no death. It's very very very hard to not generate unreasonable noise from that location with a cover open. So it's not about the prior operators but the inherent risk and because of the inherent risk this process is needed which are enforcable credible mechanisms to address the concerns of the community. Thank you. Thank you. Macy, I also live in one life. I just wanted to make the point that let's assume for the sake of argument MCR complied with all the posting notice requirements. We know the paperwork was filled out. We found that the committee did its due diligence, etc. Those things may all be true. But be that as it may, for a variety of reasons that aren't worth relitigating today, the community was underinformed and underengaged. So the community voice was not heard. And while it's understandable that the committee the committee's frustrated at taking a step backward and no one wants to waste the board and committee's time, it would be wrong nonetheless and create like bad incentives for the future if the proposal's approved simply by virtue of the developer skill in staying under the radar in the early stages of development. Just because we didn't hear about it and now we're going to be, you know, it's going to be swept, our concerns are going to be swept aside. I don't think that makes sense. I believe I was called as well. Okay. I've never spoken for one minute. Let's try it. My wife my biggest concerns are with the noise as well. your name and how how can a nightclub be allowed in this residential neighborhood? I would not have to remember studio 54 entrance were around the lot at all hours even when the club was virtually empty to give the illusion of massive demand. The noise from these lines was deafening. the best solution is not to allow a nightclub and we just I thought heard a little individually there will not be a nightclub or it is not a night I'm not sure what that meant but if it's true that's terrific but if it's approved for some god offer reason there must be enforcable restrictions i.e. No one allowed outside except for coming and going. No interest line. No smoking area. The decible levels must be kept monitored and enforced to be within allowable limits. During the hotel's previous ownership, when the city prohibited smoking in bars, its patrons would come out on the sidewalk to smoke and under the influence of it of alcohol would bow and laugh and well into the early morning inhibiting all of us from sleeping. Thank you. What building are you from? building where you the name and where you lived. So I've been 48 years 45 I'm sorry moved in 198 Oh my god. I believe I was called from online or he was the one that was next. Okay, please go ahead. Hi, my name is I'll make it Yeah, I'll make it fast. My name is Orio. I live in Fort Lexington, the building adjacent to the hotel. My apartment faces the interior courtyard as well. Everyone's discussing the noise issue which is absolutely correct. I just want to be a bit more specific and that it is the base that travels up from both the basement and the rooftop which is on a different test different level of noise. It actually as as another neighbors claimed causes vibrations. All right. If you look at the actual study that was conducted by your quote unquote best in New York City, you will see in that report and the study, he had the same issues with the bass levels called with the speakers that are used. So when we say noise, it's noise and vibrations and bass. And I'll also second the the comp the traffic, both cab and Uber traffic, the loiterers that are smoking outside late at night. Again, we're all in favor of the hotel reopening. love it, but it needs to be done respectfully and at hours that are respectful to this residential area. And I'll end with I agree that frankly it's an insult to give us such little notice to do our diligence and make our our concerns communicated. Thank you so much. Do we have anyone else who'd like to speak? Okay. at 16. we shared the sidewalk with the hotel. I understood from Tyler Morris that there is not going to be a dance club that serves 240 people. That is different than what we've been told. Is that in fact the statement of fact that there is not going to be a dance club in the south that serves 240 people? Can I get an answer to that or this is not a trial but I'm I'm being impuged. My integrity is being eviscerated here not a which more satisfying. You don't have to answer my question but goes to my point. My point is is that I live on the second floor of Grammarly Park, 60 Grammy Park North. There are going to be people smoking cigarettes. They're going to be What is your demographic for a dance club that serves 240 people liquor? It's probably 21 to 26 years old. We're going to have people slamming six shots and then smoking cigarettes under my window. And I do not want that. I will not be able to sleep. The New York City noise law is 1000 p.m. to 700 a.m. We want our neighborhood quiet from 1000 p.m. to 7 a.m. We don't want bumper to bumper a full bird is lit on taxi cab blow blowing their horns under our windows at 4 a.m. when you dump 240 people out of the bar. And I think that's Do we have anyone else who would like to speak? We'd like to move on if we Hey, I'm here because what's being proposed for the R Park Hotel isn't just a liquor license. It's It isn't speak easy. It's not a night log. It's not a lounge. It's a mess. Mr. Morris's remarks and equivocations aside, NCR's T TW hotel doesn't face these issues. It's in the middle of the airport, but their highlight hotel is in the rental neighborhood. The following is based on public documents I'm happy to provide because the record still matters. The landmarks preservation commission has in the past found that NCR has installed RS in areas without permit. He was found by community board 4 to be out of compliance with noise laws, possibly state liquor laws and involved in year-long dispute over the word over the meaning of the word music. This isn't about me or you or they or them. It's about how we organize our lives together, compromise commitment and community standards that work. We we need earlier music cut off times, a real plan for how people will move in and out of venture space, drastically reduce sidewalk aphase, earn an impartial acoustic study, and a scale of use that fits the block in our human and canine community. We'll have three people online who have requested to speak. Edith Charlton, you're up next. Up next. Go ahead. My name is Edith Charlton and I have lived at 60 Gasy Park for 65 years. My building is part of the neighborhood working group. I strongly object to granting liquor licenses to MCR for use in their proposals for a roof garden open until 4 a.m. a speak easy for 240 occupancy, outdoor dining and other entertainment venues that MCR has proposed in the past. Except for the roof garden, these are all new venues requiring new liquor licenses. We are already surrounded by bars and restaurants on Third Avenue and Park Avenue South. I have also heard of a wine bar opening at 38 Gazy Park, causing someone at your last liquor licensing meeting to call 21st Street a bar corridor. if the hotel's massive outdoor dining is permitted. MCR has not involved our community at all regarding their plans for the hotel. No contact. That is difficult to understand since there is to be outdoor seating for 93 hours from 7:00 a.m. to 4 a.m. I believe this new hotel will become more of an entertainment center than a residential hotel if liquor licenses are granted for the entire hotel, its interior and exterior, meaning 21st Street and Lexington Avenue. According to Samuel Ruggle's deed, Gary Park is the name of both a private park and surrounding neighborhood. Has this deed been studied by the board? Has the hotel's impact on our community been discussed regarding deliveries, noise, increased food traded vehicle traffic at all hours, which our streets and sidewalks were not intended to handle. Our residential neighborhood will be greatly affected if all these liquor licenses requested are granted. In July of 1916, this neighborhood was proclaimed a residential district. Let's work to keep it that way, and I hope you will object to their applications. Thank you. Next on the list is Susan Lindenhower. Miss Lindenhower, you have three minutes to speak. You may begin now. You can't speak if you're muted. Let's move on to Stephen Reed, please. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. just wait one moment. Your time is started. Please please proceed. I am Susan Lindau. I am Susan Lindenhower. I am a resident of 45 Grammarcy Park North for more than 50 years. I really love the community in which I live. and I really hope that the hotel which was at one point a vibrant part of the community can become one in the future. I look forward to being able to dine as I have in the past in the hotel. And I in fact used the rooms in the hotel to put up guests for my family for a number of occasions. I really hope that the hotel recognizes that it is located in a beautiful area that has some in inhibiting factors. namely Lexington Avenue ends at Grammarly Park and vehicles that travel on Lexington Avenue have to make a turn at a very narrow righthand turn onto 21st Street. 21st Street at the same time is a through street used by traffic, general traffic, by trucks and by also the police precinct which is located one block away on 21st Street. This creates enormous traffic problems today. And if we had a outdoor cafe xisting with those conditions, it would make it even far worse for the residents of the community and for the guests at the hotel. the traffic would be impeded by significant number of people dro being dropped off in cars, Uvers or whatever. I really think that the hotel would will be a wonderful addition to the community but I think the notion of a large That's time. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. I think we have one more person. It looks like their hand has gone down. Their hand's gone down. do we have anyone here who'd like to speak in favor of the hotel? We've heard sir, go ahead. Three minutes starting now. I'm Alan Firestein. I'm the acoustic consultant for the hotel. I wrote the report that you guys have gotten and I've heard the comments that you made in the past and also tonight and I agree with your concerns. I do a lot of work for people who are disturbed by noise by bars, nightclubs, restaurants. I've been doing this for 49 years. The recommendations I made address bass, mid-range sound, and treble sounds. In my report, I have recommendations for how loud the sound systems can be and how they have to be locked and limited both in the cellar, which is below grade, and there's no direct entrance to the street on the first floor, the second floor, and on the rooftop. I've addressed the roller cover and I made recommendations for how loud the sound can be in all those locations with a lock limiter. I even put in in my report a data sheet for the limiter that I usually recommend which is very successfully implemented and I've also put in recommendations for how to lower the base so the base is also locked at a low level. Too often, nightclubs, bars, especially rooftops play music uncontrolled, unlimited. They don't have any clue as to how loud the sound should be. They disturb the neighbors. It causes labor license problems, even violations. Unfortunately, PE inspectors, as many of you know, are not really up to snuff in terms of dealing with these problems. So it really had to be started to work be worked on right from the beginning. I worked for a number of years with Rich and Dyra DCA in an attempt to make this a requirement for all bars and nightclubs that they have to do a sound study and adhere to recommendations. So typically boards do is they accept stipulations saying this will happen, this will be enforced and will be monitored. So that's what I'm recommending. I put it in my report and I'll be happy to answer any questions from anyone either before or after the meeting or during. Thank you. I suggest that if you have questions for the acquisition that would be done outside of our meeting, please. Thank you. You have a comment that impacts his report. Can we make that quickly? I do not think his report takes into account the full capacity of the over 300 people that were going to be in the in the establishment. So we would ask that you look at that and that you disregard the report because it's not it may not be accurate. Although we weren't the same capacities as it was. Yeah. Let's please we're not here to just we're not here to argue facts. Please, please, if you have questions for the acquisition, I think you can do it later. we we've heard the information. I'm not sure there's much else we can do to to help that. So, is anyone else want to make a comment who has not already made a comment? I'll be David Johnson. I live on Lexington. Other people and others have adequately discussed the speak easy concerns the sidewalk dining concerns the rooftops imply had on the traffic. Let's not forget the 13 is a block away. It travels on that 21st street. So that's we got to be completed traffic studies. I just wonder given the fact the hotel's not going to open for more than a year, why why not a pause on the liquor license till everything been been fully. Thank you. All right. Can we move on, please? sir, if you have brief comments. I do. Well, you need the microphone, please, or people won't be able to hear you. that when we were voting or when we were recording our vote here, there were a number of hands raised back with the MCR group and I think it's worth worth saying and this is only a room with so many people in it and the proportion was drastically affected by people who who were raising their hands in favor of a hotel when I think a significant portion of the people in the room were hotel employees I would assume. and sir, I think we're taking that count more in terms of trying to limit the number of speakers. It's not an issue of like who's for against. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We will move on to our next issue. I'm sorry. Do we have someone else who wanted to speak? Hi, my name is Rebecca. I'm a director at MCR. I'm in charge of design and programming for our independent hotel. I'm also married to Mars. We've been married for almost 20 years and we both live in CB6, but we do live on 12 street. So we're neighbors a little bit to this side. we have two young daughters and we live in a city neighborhood as well. So we very much understand your concerns and it is my deepest hope that a year or two from now we are all together in the Birmy Park Hotel has been awesome addition to your incredibly strenful neighborhood that we've loved to learn more about and being a part of over the last two years we worked extensively with the GCY Park Association which we be an organ organization of 2,000 people that lived in the neighborhood. We've attended Christmas tree lightings in the middle of Fantasy Park. Our children led the Halloween parade all around the perimeter of the park for the last two years running. I really hope they do it again next year. So, I just want to let you know that the kind of establishment we want to run is one that is familyfriendly. We're a family business. We are going to be there all the time. I'm sure you can also understand as a fivestar hotel, the last thing we want is people standing outside all the hours of the day and making noise. that would not make for a great hotel. That's for sure. And we want it to be a great hotel. the property has been was purpose built as a hotel in 1925 and it's been a hotel all those years since. Is our intention to return it to something that is worthy of your neighborhood. That is the spirit and soul of of the 1925 era in which it was built and is worthy again of the architecture and the soul of your neighborhood. you know, show you the kind of the Gravity Park Live Association does not Excuse me, sir. Please, please. we have two other people who have raised their hands. If they have additional comments, please go ahead. Brian Manning, please go ahead. Hi, my name is Brian Manning. I'm a resident of one Lexington Avenue for almost 10 years and I've consolidated my statement just to the two core issues that I have. The current proposal allowing for liquor to be served in multiple locations including the outdoor dining area could really become a noisy waiting spot for people waiting to get into the clubs and multiple venues andor leaving the speak easys main floor bars and everything else. Between this and the increased capacity across venues, it'll further exacerbate an already congested intersection, especially problematic for emergency vehicles. The other is the sound systems. There has to be a solution for lowering and sealing the roof or whatever needs to be done to comply with the New York City sound guidelines, which I believe are 10:00 p.m., not 11:00 a.m. as I mentioned before, the hotel is very personal to me. My wife and I were married there. where he hosted colleagues and friends and everything there. And I'm an entrepreneur. I fully support a revitalized GPH in in the neighborhood, but it has to fit the e ethos of the neighborhood. So, I'm hoping CB6 will take this into account and and form get it formally addressed by the developer before approving this application. Thank you. All right, our last speaker is Stephen Reed. hi. Can everyone hear me? Yes. Yeah. so I echo everything that everyone has said about the concerns about the neighborhood. I've lived in the neighborhood since the mid 90s for since 2001. I've lived at 60 Park North. The the neighborhood is first and foremost a quiet one. my building happens to share a back courtyard with the hotel. And while everyone I know is generally welcoming and even excited about the hotel, we're all very upset to hear about the plans to potentially put in a base thumping club literally right at our own back door with further plans to clog the sidewalks with outdoor seating and the rooftop bar and music. Right. So all that is good. I I I echo it. I' I've tried to con condense this down. I living here there were times where in the prior incarnation of the hotel there were parties being held there or events or or ceremonies and when the bands or DJs were playing you could it it would it wasn't that it was super loud outside. It was as somebody had pointed out the bass thumping shaking of the building was the thing that was most awful. great to hear that the hotel is very concerned about our our concerns and will not do that. But if something happens and they do and there's a change of ownership and suddenly there is you know there are people that come late night and we want to keep the bars the bars open and play loud music. There is no recourse then for anybody else in the neighborhood to be able to do anything about it and that's the thing that concerns me the most. so I would strongly recommend that we disallow the current proposal from the hotel until there's more time to discuss what the controls could be around it. Thank you. Okay, we actually do have one final person who would like to speak. Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Bernstein, who has Thank you everyone. My name's Donald Bernstein. I'm Tyler's attorney in commission with this application. I I I've been doing this a long time. I hear these sorts of issues all of the time and as Alan Firestein said, some of the neighbors have some reasonable concerns about noise and I understand that but we can deal with it. What I don't appreciate, however, is the malignment of Tyler Morris. I think that is unfair that should not be permitted in this meeting. Tyler for a year and a half has spoken to the ground park association on a regular. You know, I didn't last at your comments, so you have to give me my time to speak and not be rude. Please, please continue. He has spoken to this block association, had every reason to believe that this block association represented the community and had regular ongoing discussions with them, and also spoke to some people in other buildings. He presumably didn't speak to the people in this room, but did find out about the fact that they didn't work with the bar association until we were here a month ago. And as you asked us to do last month, over the past few weeks, we had met with residents and we've spoken to them about these issues. So all of that stuff doesn't matter. Here we are today. We know what their issues are and we've addressed them. Some of the general issues, let me speak. Some of the general issues are the fact that this is a hotel. This is not like this was a vacant lot. This is not like there was a nail salon here and we're erecting this 20story hotel. This has been a licensed hotel since 1933. For 90 years, this has been a licensed hotel. The building's not changing. It's the same building. Now, with respect to the issues that are of concern, we can address them. The rooftop, unlike Steven Greenberg, a club operator, Ian Shraderger, a club operator, AB Rosen, a real estate, Tyler has 150 hotels throughout the country. Do you know how many nightclubs he has? Zero. Not a single one. Now, as Alan Ferstein told you, and we commissioned him, we had to pay him a lot of Maloneyy to do the studies. Why did we do the study? Because we want to make sure noise is not going to be a problem. That's why it's not for show. It's for real. He's the most honored and respected acoustician in the city. Still, people malign him and laugh at him, but he is. And as he said, he often represents residents if he believes and knows that they are right. Unlike all of the private operators, we will have a roller cover that will close by 11 p.m. And there is no law that says that you can't have people outside after 10. I don't know where people are getting it from. That is not correct. We would close it at 11 p.m. So that there will be no outdoor space and rooftop. Excuse me, sir. Stop. Could you please be quiet and let him speak? I don't think I interrupted any of the people that spoke before, so I deserve a little respect there. There will be no outdoor space in the rooftop after 11 p.m. the outdoor seating on the outside on the ground floor level. We are not applying for a sidewalk cafe. If we decide we want to have one and next year we'll come back. We'll go to DOT. We'll deal with that. Then with respect to the seller space, this is so great. There are no windows. We have agreed after the twist of the neighborhood that there be no direct access onto the street. We added a few seconds for the interruptions, but yes, it is time. Great. We hope that you support the resolution of your committee. Thank you. Thank you. We will move on to our next issue. We'd let we and please we're not having questions. If you'd like to ask a question, you can. He happened to speak last. This lawyer guy just happened to raise his hand as the very last Could you please calm down? We asked who else wanted to speak. There are no other raised hands of people. Is there anyone here who would like to speak who has not spoken already? Okay, then please go ahead. I've been listening. You need the microphone, please. Sorry. Hi, my name is Patricia Star. I've been listening to all of you. I'm I I live at seven Lexington for 35 years. I live in an apartment on Lex that faces the hotel. I've also been on my board for 20 years. So, I think I've had a front row seat to every iteration of this hotel. I think I hear everybody but I think what NCR is missing is the in tremendous increase in capacity and living here even in the old hotel with much less capacity not they didn't have the 240 seat speak easy that they're proposing no sidewalk seating. So even without that capacity there were double parked idling cars honking horns to all hours. Very diff difficulty for our residents to our ultra residents who are handicapped with walkers. We have a lot of young families with strollers almost impossible to park in front of our building and empty a car and and fill up a car. And it was it affected our life greatly. And I think the big one of the big issues we'd like to address is this tremendous increase of capacity. We feel that it is not we the traffic will be unacceptable. So I just wanted to make that as an you know an additional point. We'd like to move on. We do have one more person who has raised their hand. Do you really want to speak? Holly Dando, you have three minutes starting now. Sorry, I just had to unmute. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay, great. My name's Holly Dando. I've lived at 60 Garcy Park North for over 20 years. I moved here because it's a quiet and safe place to call home. I'm deeply concerned about the plans for the redevelopment of the hotel. While my concerns relate to noise, hour hours of operation and beyond, I want to talk about safety. I offer these comments as someone with mobility challenges that have required me to use a cane or a walker since 2022. The out for Lexington Avenue in Gary Park North is outsized 93 seats where there has been a single sidewalk seat for 100 years. This will eat up the sidewalk and make the streets unpassable. I rely on both these streets in my daily living. 93 seats will eat up. Sorry, repeat. It will be a public nuisance for people like me. Traffic will seize to a halt with the coming and going of this new venue. I believe it's best to avoid sidewalk dining overall at 21st and less. It will turn this corner into a street show of diners, servers, and others. It will block police vehicles from the 13th precinct from timely response to emergencies. I ask the community board to consider my clear objection to the proposed plan. It's not safe. Thank you. Thank you. We will now move on to our next issue. as you can see, time is running out for this meeting. We'd like to have the same We'd like to have maybe a show of hands for everyone here who's here for the 34th Street busway. Who is in first? Let's go with who is against the busway? We'll just have a show of hands. against. Please keep your hands raised. Sorry. We have one, two, three, four, five, six, right? 6 7 8 9 10 11. And for those against or those four, if you could please raise your hands. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. And online, please. Like eight. Eight. 10. 10. So we have eight again. Oh, he's gone. Okay. Can you make up your mind? Yeah. So, it would be really fantastic if we could have several people from each side represent what they'd like to say and then we move forward. check your reports. Yeah. would that be acceptable if we had say three people from each side? No. I think it would be acceptable. Yeah. All right. We're going to go. We're going to go. We'll start the list, but we cannot hear everybody. I hope people understand that. On order. Yes. If you as chair determine that the comments are repetitive or deliatory, you can is that in Robert's room. Excellent. Thank you. Please do so. Okay. And and you know, out of kindness, we will ask our high school students first. okay. Let's go ahead. Please come up. We don't know your name, but we'll cross you off the list as you stay start with your name and then you'll have three minutes. Okay, but be brief. You can Hey, I'm August Boy. I'm a member of Transportation Alternatives, a youth activist committee. my name is Chris and I'm also a member of the transportation alternatives youth activist committee. so we had gone over I believe it's the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association's website and saw some of their complaints about the street bus and we just wanted to go over a couple of those points and address them. So one complaint was that fat that is saying that fat is disappearing. I believe that what they're saying is that with the 14th Street busway, people are transitioning their mode of travel as a result of this with you know best ways for traffic. People are moving to other transit. we also heard a complaint about air waste pollution. We believe that the 34th Street will help damage this actually because like I said the transit and some worry it'll displace traffic but we've seen with the 14th street bus way that this simply doesn't happen and local street travel times barely increase and critically on 14th street buses bus speeds increase by as much as 24% and the DT is estimating a 15% speed increase on 13th Street, which is a significant improvement. and on a personal note of 14th Street, I ride 14D to the school every day from Union Square down to Avenue D and Alston. And for the section where I get to go on the bus way, bus speeds are significantly faster. And we also heard one complaint was that 34 Street is different because of the tunnel access on the other side. we wanted to point to 181st Street which is also located at busway where there's the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey and I believe the Washington Bridge over the Bronx on either side of it and despite those similar connections to 34th Street. it's scale improved commutes for over 42,000 bus riders. or the 62 or 70% of unfairly associated users who take the bus. So a busy can still be successful even when it has you know connections to voter on each side. Yeah. And as an East Harland resident, for many people in my comm community, accessing Midtown and other parts of the city often relies on like efficient bus connections. particularly on nature across town streets like 34th. and when these buses get stuck in traffic, it directly impacts our ability to go to work, school like, and extracurriculars, adding to like time and preparation. So, thank you. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. So, let's have someone who's against the bus way. Please raise your hand. Who wants to speak? This gentleman's will let him go. Oh, the one I said the one in the back. Sorry. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Thank you for see. My name is Brit Smith. I live at 114 East 36th Street. I would just like to say that there's basically a lack of conclusive data available on the impact of this proposal. I ask that the board and community board or elected officials please pause on voting for this project. I'm going to quote Rachel Eisenberg from last week's Department of Transfer from the Department of Transportation on last week's June 2nd CB6 transportation committee meeting posted YouTube at 27 minutes and 15 seconds. She said, quote, "Dynamic traffic modeling is currently incomplete. studies are underway and we will be able to provide you with the information and results of those studies and statistical analyses once they've been completed. End quote. How can you as our elected officials approve any project based on inconsistent nonavailable data, especially one that will have a negative impact on the residents of our community 24 hours a day, 365 days a week? How can you draft a traffic management plan with non-existent data? Is there a traffic management plan? has a health committee weighed in on the subject? And if so, what have they had to say? And why have we not been provided with that information? Have you as our community representatives held the community town hall meeting like the one that you did for the proposed casino? I'm not aware of one. And if there was one, when was it? And attended. one will conduct a community survey, a community, I'm sorry, when you conduct a community survey and engage the actual residents of the community with the impacts of this project. How can you calibrate the impact of this project on your our community with incomplete data and non-existent data? How could you vote on a project that will impact our community with non-existent data? what is the role of community board particularly community board 6? If you do not listen to or engage with the community, please do not undermine the trust that we have in you. Please do not vote on this proposal at this time. Wait for the data to come in. Thank you. And sir, we are we're not actually elected and we did not hold it to the town hall on the casino just to clarify. Thank you. and tell us about let's have somebody who's for the casino. I'd love the idea of being in the room. No one's for the casino. I'm sorry. Let's for the bus way. And if you two gentlemen would like to come together, that would be fantastic. Okay. Start with your name and then you'll have three minutes. All right. My name is Jeff. Lifelong Manhattanite, I lived here my entire life and like the majority of Manhattan residents, I rely on buses and trains. I don't drive. I honestly don't intend to. one of the great things about this city is the fact that you can get bus train service throughout most parts of the city that you need to get to. 34th Street is a really component part of that. especially considering that there's no subway line there. Like the 34th Street cross town that exists there now for transit riders is the only option. And when that gets stuck, that creates a a massive wall in the system at large. Most of people most of the people on 34th Street who are using the Avenue are taking transit. it can prevent for that matter of people who live in the area don't own cars. They are relying on mass transit. This is in my opinion the most obvious transportation solution you could do here. like this is buzz racks represent the vast majority of street users on 34th street. and it's not they're not people from far field. These are people within the city. These are New Yorkers who use this day in day out. if you do this bus proposal it will have an immediate impact to get will in the best possible way. it will be increasing trip times as we saw with 14th street. There will be relative increases. there'll be service boosts and it just it was just a it's a no-brainer project to me. Like this really needs to be done. Like this needed to be done yesterday. Honestly, like I've been on 34 street cross town buses that even with the bus lanes are still at a crawl because there simply isn't enough priority. So I heavily encourage the board to approve this project. the data already exists. the data is already there to support this and I heavily encourage the board to support it as well because this is an obvious thing to do. The fact that it's not done already shocks me. Thank you. All right. Thank you. These two gentlemen are here. We'll get We'll You'll have your turn next. Thank you, community board saints, for letting me speak in favor of the 34th Street Bus. I am Chris Sanders and I live on 35th Street. And I would like to patronize the 34th Street buses more than I currently do. 34th Street buses are painfully slow, constantly blocked by traffic. I like to use them to go to B&H, Hudson Yard, Hudson path, and various other places on like Third Avenue to help a few friends there also. and time is life, and a fast, efficient 34th Street bus would allow me to get a piece of my life back. I realize that some people in the community and outside the community would like to see Manhattan turned into a museum, but Manhattan is a museum. It's a city. A city is supposed to grow and change and evolve. And D has presented us with the data they've been collecting since October 2024. they stated that 99% of the cars coming through the area are not staying in the area. Only 1% of the cars actually are patronizing a destination in the area. and the proposed busway on 34th Street, you know, it has to work because there is no L train there. You know, it doesn't have electrics that 14th Street has. it can't be blocked by traffic. I urge the community board 6 to give the people of New York City a piece of their life back and to join community boards four and five who both support the 34th Street Busray. Thank you again, community board 6, for letting me speak. Thanks. Thank you. Okay, Siri, you're up next and then we're going to go to someone online. Good evening. My name is David Sman. I live in L Hill. if you ask me if I support 34th Street Bus, of course I do. What do you do? We all want the buses to go more quickly. The real question is, as the other journal mentioned, do you support the 34th Street busway if it's going to send thousands of vehicles onto the side streets? Not at all. A lot of people say, "Well, that end up being a duplicate of things." If that's true, that would be wonderful. Where is the data? What is that traffic analysis that I just heard was done since October 2024 or June 2025. discussing this without the data I think is you know putting the cart before the horse or my new exact cliche there do says there are 28,000 people who use the 34th street bus there are 56,000 who live in Murray Hill who are going to be impacted there 79,500 vehicles that go through the Midtown Tunnel every day. There aren't too many blocks where those vehicles can go. When you remove 34th, logic says that they're going to go on 35th, 36, 37th, 38, 39. They can't go on 40th. Doesn't I mean they can't go in the 40s because they're going to hit Brian Park or Brady Central. This is going to have a real impact on our network. I can tell you because I see the traffic. The the streets are already quiet. And I wish I were wrong. If it turns into 14th Street, that would be wonderful. We We'd be celebrating. But why can't D give us those numbers? What is there to discuss before we know how the entire neighborhood may be decimated? Thank you for listening. See, we'll start now. And again, if you can if you agree with the previous speaker or someone who's spoken before, please make your comments short. We would appreciate that. We'll take whoever's there. Let's just keep going. Daniel Sutton, three minutes. You may begin. Thank you. I support the 34th Street busway. I think it would improve Midtown traffic. It would increase bus speeds, reduce the traffic on the street, and it would make life easier for everybody that uses that corridor. So, just like on 14th Street, there were a lot of predictions that terrible things would happen, and none of those things ended up happening. It just made everything better. So, I support the busway. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. all right. Dylan, Dylan Kennedy, you have three minutes beginning now. Hi, my name is Dylan Kennedy. and I'm going to try and keep this brief for everyone. but I mostly just want to share that I've worked right by 34th and I've worked right by 18th Street and the bus way just makes it a spectacularly calmer, more peaceful neighborhood. we I never saw any of the the traffic spill over that people warned about. and and just my experience kind of working along both of those different streets has taught me that the busway makes it much more pleasant, much more faster for commuting. and just a much more pleasant neighborly feel. with that, I'd also like to say I I very much like the idea of extending the Third Avenue redesign all the way down as I'm often frequently traveling along that too and have friends in the neighborhood. but mostly from an element of just having a nice more peaceful neighborhood with faster bus speeds. and and from the experience we've learned from doing this to other similar streets, there isn't a traffic nightmare and it just makes the neighborhood so much better. So that's why I urge you to support the busway. Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll move on to Jessica Lavois. You have two minutes. Thank you. Good evening. my name is Jessica Lavoy. I am a vice president of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association and chair of its quality of life committee. I'm here to express serious concern about this board considering to advance a 34th Street busway without proper community engagement or real data-driven planning. There's still no traffic management plan. Our side streets are already congested with tunnel traffic. This plan would only make it worse, adding pollution, noise, and safety risks. This will affect our most vulnerable, especially our seniors, kids, and people with disabilities. Our tunnel traffic will not magically disappear. This is not 14th Street. 34th is a major cross town corridor, a direct link between two tunnels, and an extension of I495. You cannot copy and paste a plan meant for a completely different traffic pattern. Another important piece that is being overlooked, the MTA's own website shows that 34th Street buses, just looking at the most recent month of April, are only on average.3 miles per hour slower than the buses on 14th Street currently. Is that small gain worth the serious disruption? Also, why aren't we looking at the real issues on 34th? We need more buses. We need to enfor en enforce traffic rules, manage ride share vehicles stopping in the lanes, and fix the bottlenecks caused by express buses turning at 6th Avenue. We we really don't have enough buses on 34th Street. I take the bus every day. I have waited over 20 minutes for a bus only for it to take 9 minutes to get across town. This could easily be about service volume and not just speed. The community survey that was done, it wasn't even directed at residents. It was done by stopping random pedestrians. That is not meaningful input. It's not how you reflect a neighborhood's voice. The de the DOT has demonstrated that it is highly capable of effectively notifying the public. Whether it's street fairs or parades, they put up clear signage throughout the neighborhood. In some cases, entire blocks are lined with pink notices drawing attention to these events. That same level of visibility and outreach is missing here. Research must represent the full spectrum of community views. The city says that the traffic is already improved with congestion pricing. So why are we forcing a disruptive change now when the data we have points to progress? This process lacked transparency, planning, and balance between transit goals and neighborhood impact. We all do want better transit, but it must be done thoughtfully and responsibly. And I urge you not to move forward until there is real engagement, real data, and real solutions. Thank you so much. Next on the list is Charlie Todd. Charlie Todd, you have three minutes. You may begin. Thank you so much. thank you so much for your time, tonight. I'll be very brief. I know that there are so many speakers tonight. I am a resident of community board 4, which also includes 34th Street, but I frequently visit the whole 34th Street corridor, including the parts in CB6 to work, to shop, to access transit, for doctor's appointments. And I just want to express my strong support for the busway proposal. the 14th Street busway is a huge success. I ride my bike on 13th Street and 12th Street all the time, and there's no spillover traffic. Those streets are also very calm. and I think we deserve the same at 34th Street. Unlike 14th Street, 34th Street does not have a subway underneath it. so the bus is all we got in terms of cross town traffic. And I think it would be such a big improvement for the neighborhood and for Midtown Manhattan, both on the west side and the east side, to have us connected by this busway. I think it's time to prioritize pedestrians and transit users and not the minority of residents who use their personal cars to get around or use their personal cars to cut through from New Jersey to Long Island. as a father of two elementary school kids, I look forward to a safer 34th Street with a busway. Thank you so much for your time. All right. Thank you. Next on the list is David Lawrence. David Lawrence, you have three minutes. I'm going to take just 30 seconds. I want to echo what Jessica outlined. the issue is not whether we want better bus service. The question is on what basis are the decisions going to be made. Are they going to be made on a fully informed basis with the necessary data with the necessary planning and with the overall quality of life? There is no question that the people who visit the neighborhood and the people who live in the neighborhood deserve better bus service. The question is what are the best ways to achieve this? And I think Jessica did an excellent job in outlining outlining alternatives as well as the need for the data. And just I'll conclude on this point. It is not a question of whether the city representatives have the data that the DOT has. The question is whether the DOT has actually obtained and analyzed sufficient data and that is the missing gap here and hopefully you will understand that as part of the fiduciary obligations to the neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Next on the list is Paul Prickler. Mr. Prickler. Three minutes. Thank you. My name is Paul Crick. I use the cross town buses all the time. I think every major cross street up and down Manhattan, 14th, 23rd, 34th, 42nd, as far north and south as you can go, should be a a busway like 14th Street. Imagine if you could live five or six blocks away from anywhere in Manhattan or a lot of Manhattan. You can guaranteed to get across town in 10 15 minutes. It would transform how tens or hundreds of thousands of people get across Manhattan. make it a nicer, quieter place. Which leads to the final thing I'd like to say. 14th Street, it'd be a nice quieter place like 14th Street, which is much, much quieter now. I went down to 14th Street the weekend when it became the bus way. The first the first thing I noticed was you could talk to someone, you still can across the street because cars don't drown out human conversation. And the second thing was there was no Carmageddon. Everyone was worried about this Armageddon that didn't happen. and it seems like it's magic. The cars just disappeared away. And in in a sort of sense, they did. I got to think afterwards, it's simply the opposite of when they widen the highway and more cars come to fill it. Then you have to widen it again. That's the marginal users joining the the the race there. It works the other way around as well. It was the marginal users who stopped using it. And the same will happen again. It becomes a better place for everyone. So, I I'm strongly in support of this. I'll also speak for for 10 seconds about Third Avenue. Hugely in support, much safer. I would love it to be extended. Love the wide bike lane and love the offset crossing. Please can we though have concrete islands all the way up and down third avenue. Thank you very much. Okay. next is Miriam Fiser. Miriam Fischer, three minutes. can you hear me? Yes. Okay. I'm from community board 4, which as I think you are doing a joint project with four and five. one of the things I've been getting on the radar is as we improve bus the bus ways to think about the bus stops which often have no seats and no shelter from inclement weather from 95 degree heat from snow and community board 4 added it to their letter. I was probably the catalyst, but they are actually working on improving the bus stops in the district and I wanted to again raise awareness to community board 6 to get ask the DOT to examine the bus stops, shelters, seats and include that in any any request for the bus way. Thank you. We'll go back to in person. All right. do we have people? We don't know from our list if you're in person or but again, Andrew Hyatt, are you in the room? Thank you. Okay, we'll go with Andrew Hyatt. Oh, thanks. So, I I live I love athletes equidistant between 14 and 34. So I was involved also in the 14th Street discussions the same thing because cardologically we're happy to go somewhere but they do just disappear and they did just disappear. I I walked to work along you know to solve the 14th street. I don't see any real problems and I I kind of hope for that good situation to happen to 34th Street as well which to my mind 14th Street really increase the safety of that neighborhood or for myself and for my my family and I I think that's something that the residents of this neighborhood also would appreciate for them and their families. so I I hope that we could consider that even though it seems like the neighborhood will be flooded with cars. This like we stop 14 street like anytime you do this kind of this kind of mitigation car to lots of people to choose to do something else transport somewhere else whatever. So this this happens and it will happen again. I'm looking forward to what this neighborhood collecting is going to make it much much better. Thank you. Scott Riiffken, are you in the room? Scott Riiffken. Richard Hart, are you in the room? He's online. Richard Hart, three minutes. Hi, how are you? Or less. Yeah. Yes. Or less. My name is Richard Hart. Thanks for listening. I live on 35th Street between Park and Lexington. And I like some others here am very nervous about what this community board is thinking and somewhat disheartened that it's thinking about this without any data whatsoever because the Department of Transportation hasn't prepared anything. I mean, that's obvious. And I just want to cite for the committee one of the things it wrote in its most recent 2025 statement of community needs. In this document you write traffic in CD6 is a major concern. We need a traffic study and action plan to understand how vehicular flow can improve with major vehicular transit points like the 59th Street Bridge, Queen Midtown Tunnel, and FDR, plus sometimes all day avenue and side street congestion. Solutions need to be identified to allow better movement for private cars, buses, bikes, and pedestrians alike. By agreeing to this 34th Street busway without any of that data, it seems to me that there's really no way for you to meet your duty of care and duty to your constituents. I understand that there's a lot of magical thinking about how cars will just disappear. But if they don't, then it's the people that live in this neighborhood that will be impacted, not the bus riders or the bike riders that like would like a slightly faster 34th Street corridor. So, I would like the board to really think about understanding what the traffic implications are for a third of its community before agreeing to even vote on this. And the one final thing I will say is that traffic, noise and air pollution models are not linear when things get very busy. In fact, traffic congestion eased only 12% in the congestion zone in New York while noise complaints declined 67%. And I think you're going to put Murray Hill right back in that hot seat if you do this. and I'm hoping you really think carefully about waiting for the data, waiting for a traffic analysis that can be questioned and that can be discussed before moving forward with this proposal. Thank you. All right, let's All right, Lily Seedman Davis. Lily Seedman Davis, you have three minutes. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes. Oh, terrific. So, while I fully support improved public transit and reduced congestion, this is not the answer. 34th Street is a critical east-west link between the Midtown and Lincoln tunnels. Closing it to private vehicles won't reduce congestion. It's simply displacing it. Traffic will flood into narrow residential streets which are illequipped to handle the increase. This plan doesn't make traffic vanish, it shifts it. And when it gets repositioned into residential neighborhoods, it chips away at livability, safety, and community integrity. We deserve better than a solution that simply relocates the problem. This is not opposition to transit improvements, but to show but to shortsighted planning that overlooks the real world impact on residents. I urge city leaders to consider more balanced alternatives. Initiate comprehensive traffic and environmental studies at a minimum. In addition, where's enforcement with ticketing cars that block bus lanes? Add more buses to address this. Think about under under the subway system in terms of building something from that perspective. But please reconsider this plan. We all want a better city, but better must include everyone. Thank you for listening and considering the views of residents who call Murray Hill home. Okay, we have two more. Dana Freriedman. Dana Freriedman, you have three minutes. Hi. how are you? my name is Dana Freriedman. I live on 37th Street, which is one of the streets that exits out of the tunnel. I fully support the bus way. I want to just get that out of the way. everyone seems very concerned about the traffic, but I just you know, want to say that there's a tendency of people to always imagine the worst case scenario and it actually never comes to fruition. We heard about it with congestion pricing. we heard about it with the 14th Street busway. We heard about it when they wanted to take the cars out of Central Park, when they want to take the cars out of Prospect Park. Everyone always cries wolf and I I hear people saying that they want more studies. I get the sense that people wouldn't even believe the studies if it showed, you know, that there wouldn't be any difference. And I want to just end by saying that the city, the heartbeat of the city is public transportation. And I feel like as a city we have a responsibility to ensure that we have the best public transportation you know possible. and you know there are times where you know decades from now where we all won't be here anymore living in Murray Hill. There'll be a community board that is turned over you know four or five times. But there could be a legacy of a busway, a status quo, of that we are, you know, putting these programs into place that are going to benefit tens of thousands of people and we should be supporting that and not impeding progress. Cities are about making progress and we should be do everything we can to move forward. Thank you. And I fully support the busway. We have some more people who would like to speak in the room, but I highly recommend consolidating your comments, please. We're we're losing patience here. So, I think we'll follow down through the list. We have a list here of people who've signed up information. How many more people How many more people have we? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And two online. And two online. It's and unfortunately we're we're losing out time but so are we calling from the list or we call from the list or we call people not competitive. Let's go ahead. Who's next on the list? Okay. On the list Chris Sanders. Is Chris Sanders in the room? Okay. Okay. Max Mlaughlin. Is Max in the room? Okay. And John Noble. Is John Noble in the room? Okay. Basically in support of the busway. Something to add that something. Okay. Supports the bus way. That's how to be brief. Yes. Yes. Samir Lia, are you in the room? Okay. Charlton Duza, are you in the room? Stacy Roush, are you in the Rous? Are you in the room? Okay. And here comes the microphone. Three minutes or much less. The other subject, everybody said where they lived, which would explain why they were interested in the subject. Lots of people getting up saying, "I want the bus way. Do you live here? Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, let's please let go. The bigger problem is we don't have enough of them. I sat and checked on rush hour 34 and D and even 23. They had 45 buses on the roof in each direction at every single time I checked. We have two. I have waited for the 34 bus at Park Avenue for 21 minutes to go to 10th Avenue. I don't know how much faster you want it to be. I got there in 10 minutes. I also looked at the MTA's website. Right now, the 34 bus plots in at 5.9 miles an hour. Just so that you know, 14th Street, the A is 5.8 8 and the D is 6.1. So are we talking about a hairspray? No. Further 23 which has none of this and doesn't close off to traffic has also four or five buses and it moves at 6.1. So, why are we trying to change something when what I think we really need is just more buses on our roots. I think we should wait, get more buses, and check back later after the Dallas. Do not pass it now. Living on 36 Street, I know what traffic is. It goes into the tunnel. It comes from New Jersey going out to the island every day. It starts at 3 in the afternoon and there are nights it goes until 10:30. The lights are red and when they block Avenue, all they get is a lot of honking. I don't want that back. Further congestion pricing and the cars going away. Honey, New York is making an awful lot of Maloneyy from it. I don't think they've gone anywhere. Good timing. Excellent timing. You're done. Thank you. Thank you. all right. Two seconds on the list and please. Okay. Kate F. They didn't give their last name. Kate F. Are you in the room here? Three minutes. Yes, please. There you go. [Music] that have not yet been brought up. And I'll be fast. First, most of the people in support of closing 31 streets of cars don't live in the East 30s. Sorry. We are not streets. The people coming from Jersey are never going to give up their cars. Not only that, I live on East 36 Street. I have a front work seat to all traffic coming in and out of the tunnel every day at rush hour every week. We cannot handle more traffic on these roads. We need 34th Street to handle some of the capacity. 34th Street has five lanes, two of which are buses. Those greener lanes are very much necessary. I take the 34th Street bus very often. I rely on it a lot and it's actually fast. I'm impressed with it. It takes 10 minutes to get from Third Avenue to Hubs and Yards. What's not fast is waiting for us on that street. The problem is not traffic. They should not be. So we need traffic enforcement and we need buses to run off. Not only that, we have hospitals here. We have medical facilities. We have all the extra patients that have to walk around the corridor to find a taxi coming out of the you know the cancer center. Like this is this is just not the best way. Faster buses. This is not the solution. And the only way to get some real accurate data would be by actually doing this and seeing what happens. That's the only way to get real data. At that point, you know, they have to undo it if it's not working out. And ambulances and fire trucks and police cars trying to come down 36 Street for emergencies, trying to get through the traffic. The cars don't want to move out of the way. They're selfish. They move out of the way for an ambulance. Just think how that's going to be. reports. There's a mic problem. We can't hear anything. We'll get to it. It's not fair. Our interest in the interest of people that would be impacted by this every day. Great. Thank you. Perfect timing and please comments that are have not been said before or Okay. Next on the list listing, [Music] there's something now wrong with the total mic system. We can't hear anything. Sandy broke up. You broke up. Can you hear me now? Yeah, that's much better. Okay. I think what happens is the mic will this mic will only register one voice at a time. So, we'll try and keep everyone orderly and speaking just one at a time. But the mic that the people are speaking on is really bad. We can't hear that either. Okay. what we can what we can do is we'll ask people to come to the front. Come to the front. Yes. Okay. All right. Nikquille Shrikumar in the room, please come up. and just waiting in the wings. Tessa Dunning, are you in the room? Tessa Dunning. Okay. No. Alex Wong in the room. No, online. Okay. All right. Well, please go ahead. Microphone. No microphone. Just try and project. That might solve it. Hi, I'm Nick Hill. I'm a member of the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association. Some of my, fellow neighborhood associate members have already talked. Just wanted to make some point just to address concerns about I said as a neighborhood association we our president wrote a letter opposing the the current iteration the current iteration of the bus proposal. We I I ride the M34 every day. I want a faster I want a faster compute as well. We're not against it. We just don't want to hy want it to be a hasty process. I also want to I think people have brought up that the data is already there. I'm not sure if we were at the beginning of the meeting but we were asking for the data and they said it was incomplete. So if once the data is complete we will leave any data showing and it's not just data with simulation like you I'm a data engineer living it's very easy to simulate traffic if you have if you have all data inputs we live in a world of AI and it's like if you gave me a week I could do it myself to be honest it's not that hard to do we have you have city funding I don't see why everybody in this group is so easily trying to push the proposal and also I kind of noticed that everybody's not to of course but everybody's talking about 14 street obviously did a ton on both sides this is all anecdotal data actual data in terms of proposing it and we can simulate that we have all the data points we need just to be complete and as at the beginning of the meeting state it not been done yet and once it's there we we can all reconvene again and as you go through the process the main point is that the neighborhood association and the M34 bus riders we want to be on the same page like we are all the same people like I take the bus every day but I don't want like I just don't want to do it in a hate manner. Thank you. Thank you. Who's next? Jonathan Miles, are you in the room? Alexander Wong. Oh, Alexander Miles. We switch back to online. Yeah. Go ahead, Alexander. Sandy, use the mic. Alexander. Three minutes starting now. He's unmuted. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry about that. sorry. I was on the wrong mic. hi. My name is Alexander Wong. I'm a lifelong New Yorker. and I'm a resident of CB6 in Sutton Place. my family had a coffee shop on 34th Street for two and a half years in 2017. So, I I know I know that area very well. I current I'm also a a cyclist and a bus rider and a subway rider and a pedestrian. and I am strongly in support of the the bus way. and I I don't think we should be you know not putting this forward because we think that we need to support drivers commuting through through 34th Street from New Jersey to Long Island. And I use cycle across town a lot because because there I don't think that a lot the 34th street has the speed and capacity to bring me to work on time and I I I have to avoid that kind of commute through 34 street and I think that I would really like to be able to use it and I think that for people who are unable to bike and who need to rely on public transit. I think that it's a really powerful option. and I'm strongly in support of the 34th Street busway. Thank you. okay. Mikail Depre. All right. Can you come up here, please? After that will be Brit Smith. Already spoken. And after that will be Marshall butt. I already actually ride by the tunnel. So I be actually one of the first impacted by and I'm here to express my for yeah some people say we're not 14 street and we're not. That's fine. But that doesn't mean we just to say 34 doesn't work for anybody not just for riders for students. It doesn't even work for cars. So question to you why should we maintain the status quo and provided extensive data indicators. One key figure stands out only 1% of vehicles have 34 street as their final destination. So instead of designing for that 1% let's focus on majority the people who actually leave work and corridor every day for this neighborhood like me living on 34 street. So I should commute. Thank you. Okay. it looks like Marshall butt is left. Kate Hzer, are you in the room? Kate. Okay. Christopher Rosario, are you in the room? Okay. Drew Robertson, are you in the room? No. Should we go online? Can I let one one last? Okay. Alex Ivanak. you have three minutes. Hello. One last, please. Hi. Thank you so much. My name is Alex Ivanac. I'm part of the family that owns Villa Bruier Restaurant. We're on 34th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues. We've been there for close to 44 45 years. So, we've seen 34th Street change over many decades. And my only concern is that the first time that I heard about this bus proposal as a business owner on the ground floor was when this was passed last week. So, nobody came to any businesses or any people who live in the neighborhood from what I know to even let us know about this proposal. It was after the fact. And my biggest concern also is the fact that people keep saying 14th Street it's so great blah blah blah. But the difference with 34th Street is that we have two major tunnels. Two, not nothing. Two, not one, but two. So, we have to figure out how that will be diverted, how that will affect. And you need to get local people more. Like I said, we've been there a long time. And the first time I heard about this, nobody came to interview me. Nobody came to interview my neighboring business. And I think that this is important to get more data regarding the traffic patterns. Thank you so much. Thank you. Who's next? Okay. Drew Robertson, are you in the room? Samuel Peter Panuio, are you in the room? Oh, yes, we Yes, you are. Okay. Where's the mic? Right here. My name is Pete. I live on 36th Street Park Avenue. I'd like to welcome all our friends from turns all that here tonight to voice their support. this this is a sham. You people are responsible for the fact that none of this information was transmitted to the community found out about this. Oh, transportation community transportation was having a meeting today. That's on you people. That's something you need to address. So, we're getting blindsided. They came on here last week and had a very well time bought out plan 34 but no test nothing. Oh, well that's not a good answer. I don't care. People say other things. You know what? Where is that report? You're talking about tens of thousands of cars that can get diverted into the side street. The people from DG don't even bother to get off their ass and cannot look what's going on over there right now. Make the projects on 34th and I'm sorry, 35th and Park, half the block, 36th and Madison also has major construction. Now to add insult to injury, Keith Powers, who should be here and he's not, he tweets the next day after the transportation board with their alleged vote last week. Keith Powers winds up tweeting, "Hey, here's a new idea. How about we shut Park Avenue down to one lane in each direction on both sides of Park Avenue?" So we already have an untenable situation and we get more and more ramp down our throats. If they can blow that past us, they would. You know what? Not going to happen. People need to make noise. Enough of this. And I have a question for you people. Are there people on this community board that are actually members of transportation alternatives? Yes or no? You asking me? Yes or no? Oh, they won. Who's on the transportation committee? He was a transportation listed as an activist. Okay, that's a problem. Sir, why is that pertinent to this discussion? You got you got and you have an activist that voted last week. He voted last week for the transportation committee. That is wrong. Please give me the mic. Will you please stop pointing your finger at our sit down? I'm not talking to you. I'm speaking to her. Give me the mic. You're welcome. Yes. Have a seat, sir. Thank you. Okay. Nobody wants to hear that stuff. Disrespectful. You think the community is not bad? Do we do we have anyone else? We are the truth because you're listening to sit down. Sit down and be quiet. Please both of you sit down. Please sit down. Please sit down. If we have anybody else who wants to speak, please let's do it now. Let's move forward. Who's next on our list? Next on the list, Brian Johnson. Brian. No, he's here. Okay, he's come up. Brian Johnson. Is it Johnson? Next on the list will be also Irma. Irma Rosenblat. Irma, please. And then Emily Jacabe. And again, gravity is is much appreciated. Absolutely. Okay. My name is East 32 for the last 27 years. And my grandson attended the river school. So I'm a native. I am in support of the We we can't hear. Okay. Sorry. And I'm a member of families. Please put your mouth up to the mic. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. So families for safe streets is a group of people who have lost loved ones to car crashes or survived crashes themselves. We fight for change to make our safe streets. I became a member of families for safe streets in 2014 when my mother Ida was killed by a speeding SUV. She was a strong empathetic person who was deeply involved in the community. She should be here today fighting along us, but it's not because our city prioritized the movement of cars over her safety. I know the pain, horror, and confusion caused by the trauma of loss stemming from a traffic crash. And I'm here today to ask for your support building this busway to improve the safety of this vital corridor for all its users. Since the implementation of the busway on 14th Street, injurycausing crashes have gone down by 42% and 84% of seniors reported feeling safer on the streets than they did before the changes were made. These figures represent a remarkable improvement in safety, and I think our neighborhood deserves the same safety in addition to the speedier commutes we will experience with a bus web. I do not like living in a community where I know my neighbors are not safe on our streets. Please support this common sense project that will improve our mobility and prevent lifealtering trauma. Thank you for listening. Emily Jacabe, are you still here? Okay. Jonathan Miles in the room or are you online? Okay. Well, then let that let's I think we've gotten everyone in the room. Let's go online. what is your name? Kate F was over there. Okay. Kate F. Who didn't? Okay. All right. All right. Please, let's go online. Okay, online. Brian fromitz, you have three minutes. All right. Hey. Yeah, I'll be quick. I just want to say that I work on 34th Street and currently if I need to get across town, I would take an Uber simply because that is the most efficient way to do so at the time. but if there was a busway, I would definitely be considering that as my priority option. And therefore, this would likely be taking cars off the road, which people are seemingly thinking that cars will only be diverted to the side streets, but in reality, I think a lot of cars will come off the road and people would choose to take the bus instead. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Samir Levvenia. Three minutes. Hi, thank you. I will also be brief. my name is Samir Lvingia. I'm a frequent rider of all the buses in New York City, including the M34. I'm also the vice chair of our transportation committee over at community board 5. And I'm asking that you support this project. I believe and it has been shown that our voices as community boards are louder when we speak as one which is the case or why we are even have this item is because we all wrote a letter together months ago asking the DOT to to come and present a busway to us so that way we could say you know this is a good idea. We are proactive and and that's why we're being rewarded with you know with this when we speak with one voice. I think it would be a shame to either not comment on it or to say no at this point. you know if we are going to ask the DOT to do things and then they do then we say oh just kidding we don't actually want it why why would they listen to us ever again so I I would really encourage you to sign on and support and lastly you know if you don't weigh in on on this item now you're not going to have a chance because the implementation is supposed to be in summer of this year and so I really encourage you to take the opportunity to weigh in today instead of not having a voice at all thank you Okay, I think you're the last person. There's one more. Sorry. Jonathan Miles, this is Jonathan Miles. I'm online, but I'll seed my time for I'm looking to speak on another matter. so, thank you. Okay. All right. I love a microphone. I don't love going live. Okay. So, two years ago, I bought my first home. It's a Thank you. Thank you. I'm a quick lady. I did it all in my home. I don't need a pull up, which is really tough to get into. Yes, I'm very proud of myself. So, I decided to get involved in my community. So, that's what brings me here today. While I'm speaking on behalf of myself only, I'd be remiss not to mention that I'm also the secretary of Mars Association. Now you might be think what does the secretary do? One of my main jobs is going after the inbox. That means the emails of the people who are sad and complain and have things on their mind. It's me who has to answer. And I do it very lovingly. But I have to say it's usually a very easy task, but this week my volunteer position became a full-time job. I had to work from home today just to get home. But the emails are all concerns from people about Murray Hill. They have nowhere else to voice their concerns. So they come to me. So these residents that I now have personally connected with all week. They're confused about the busway. They have questions about the busway. They're opposed to the bus way. You're a community board. So what I'm asking is please represent the community and listen to the people who call this place home. Relieve the confusion, answer the questions, and oppose voting until more studies and community outreach are done. It will make my job a lot easier. Thank you. Thank you. I think we have one last person, Jonathan Miles. All right, Jonathan Miles. Three minutes. I I'm online. I'm primarily speaking on another item, so I'll seed my time on this one. It's always the last meeting. Are you for or against? I am for the busway. strongly in support and I take umbrage on behalf of all the other supporting citizens of Murray Hill. that it's implied that there's not a strong presence in the room and online in favor. Thank you. All right. Okay. No, you've already spoke. We're done. We're done. sorry. The minutes from the March 14th full board meeting were distributed to board members. If there's no objection, we will adopt the minutes as drafted. If you if you object, raise your hand. Seeing no objections, the minutes from the May 14th full board meeting are adopted. They will soon be available on the CB6 website. My report, we are planning on getting together at the Sutton Place Park Celebration in Man for Manhattan Hinge July 11th at 6. Watch your email. That's it. district manager Jesus Perez will now give a report waved. Disman will give our report treasures report. I may make it very short. You'll find the whole report in the minutes, but I just wanted to comment on two numbers for community board's budget for the fiscal year and we're coming to the end of the fiscal year was $612,04. We've encumbered already 400,048 and 421. So for the remaining month that we have left, we have about $20,000 left. We're looking at our personal services because the mayor did a cost of living. We don't have the funds for it yet. So this is a different year. We really will not be turning back Maloneyy, but just covering our budget as it is. and the more details will be in the minutes. Okay, thank you. We've now arrived at our committee reports and resolutions. A reminder that the same rules stated at the beginning of the meeting apply. Members of the public, please note that during this section of the meeting, we only recognize questions from members of the board. So, the digital ballot was sent to all members. Select your name, select your vote on each resolution that's presented. Don't don't submit it till the end of the meeting. remember reminder that if you choose to abstain that's usually a negative vote. The final vote counts will be announced after the second roll call. All right. If any anything is unclear please raise your hand and we can help. First up is parks, landmarks and cultural affairs. Sarah Whittington, Neil, and I would just like to inform you all that the New York City pools are open June 27 as even there. Yes. Ster, chair of public safety and sanitation. Frank, I was asked to consolidate my resolence. It's not my skill. But the resolution that we are presenting tonight is about discovery, which is is essentially in this context in criminal law about the prosecutor giving the defendant the evidence that they possess. the rules of discovery are not trivial technicalities. about the rights of criminals. It's about detecting innocent people. His mic went out. Evidence is what's mostly turn on. And if the process goes wrong, innocent people, hold it close. Yeah. If the process goes wrong, innocent people end up basically in prison. so you end up creating additional victims. You have the victim of the original crime. Now you have the victim of the state and yet the the actual perpetrator continues to go free. So it's very important that evidence be exchanged in order for in a couple of proposals that are favored by the Manhattan District Attorney which would make the system work better. and we oppose them amendments that were put forth by the governor who apparently wants to buff her tough armed crime credentials. but the proposals would foster some injustices. I I just want to add that this is not a seat of defense resolution. The committee met for two consecutive months with both the district attorney of of Manhattan and the legal aid society. They both presented forceful, passionate, intelligent remarks. we heard their arguments and we dug into this. So this is this is a complex issue that and a considered decision. if anyone has questions, I will attempt to answer them and if there's not, we can move over. Okay, let's please mark your digital val. And while you're doing that, Steu's going to give his report. Just pardon me, just for clarity. can I move that we vote? Can I call the Oh, sure. Call the question. And can we have a second? Second. Thank you. Stu, you have a report? I wave there. Oh, okay. All right, next up we have business affairs and licensing. Anton Mhler is our chair. Bundle the resolutions that came out of this meeting we had a couple weeks ago was more than four hours. So, so 3 hours will be here. Item A item A resolution with objection for a new cannabis application for retail dispensary license for Danny Kogan. the committee had objection because Mr. go into being involved to show up to make any presentation and he didn't provide his work. So if he's not interested in doing that, we're not interested in supporting his application. Do I have a solution to bundle? Can we bundle? Yes. No, just just as it's okay. So the question follow the question. All right. So okay resolution I think they want to bundle everything. They can't. Sorry. Okay, please. All right. item B resolution in favor of candidates NYC. yeah, the applicant did abide by all the rules from control board and the presentation was appropriate and we filed resolution. judgement this application club. Okay. Okay. Now I like the motion C all the way to P. These are resolutions supporting sidewalk cafe applications for the restaurants indicated. We had a lot of problems with them. They did support they did provide us with their dot applications which are all appropriate and as the do has requested the resolutions we made are for approval not for recommendation. So I'd like to move a question one to bundle and two to vote on those items through item. So C through P. Yeah. Okay. RMS I'd like also these are modifications of their applications for the side cafes. we did approve these modifications for cafe or bowl. we asked them to modify the schematic regarding their seller door or the ugly coyote. we asked them modify their application to indicate the correct sidewalk width so that there was clear pedestrian pamp and for same thing modify their schematics for the dot to recognize the exact width of the sidewalk. Do I hear a question? Question. Second. Okay. Okay. Like the bundle T, U, and D. These are all against Sidewalk Cafe applications. we have no wishes with them and we did recommend approval. Question. Question. Second. Okay. All right. W next. These are alterations request for liquor licenses since these two applicants have received information from the do who have sidewalk cafes. And in order to serve liquor, you must get an alteration from the SLA. we have no wish for that. I'd like to call the questions on WX. Question. Okay. starting with Y H. these are all retro license requests. No application and temporary retail permits. We've reviewed every single one of them. None of them have had any issues. None of them had any complaints on their premises and they were all approved by the business affairs committee. Would somebody call a question? Second. I'm sorry [Music] objection application temporary brief permit for wine and beer and sire license to find 193rd Avenue South as a no show did submit the questionnaire and the committee felt there was not enough interest to do that we don't have enough interest to take their no objection. So we object to their new application. All the question. Okay. Last but not least, JJ resolution requiring application temporary retail permit for on purposes liquor license for and for Gy Park Hotel. Now obviously we've heard a lot of leaders today who are against we also have been in contact with both parties since the bulk met some weeks ago and we've had some discussions at the U am ourselves and we do have a resolution that's differs slightly from what we originally submitted to the board last month. And these changes are indicated in red on the resolution and given what we've heard tonight for and against I'd like to call the question to have the members of the board vote for this for audience. Second we have question when sorry we have one hand raised Sandra. Yeah. I'm sorry I was going to speak as a committee a community member but I realize I couldn't. I did want to I have various points but I know we are exhausted. but one was really important. The one of the ways we ended the discussion last time was that the developer was supposed to meet with the community members. They did not do that. They did not reach out to the community and I you would have a as as much as it was tonight you'd have had an even much larger push back against that was an act of bad faith. The person who said these folks act under the radar screen really inaccurate I I we don't want to have that discussion. I just want to make the point there was never a notice sent out to the community at all. Nobody in my building which has like 40 apartments has any idea of what's going on. That was went in complete opposition to what we had decided was what these folks needed to do. That needs to be on the table so you understand that was duplicitous in my mind. They could have met with five people. They never reached out to the community. I want you folks to know that. Okay. I think I mean I can help clarify this condition which I believe that Sandre left off as saying that it was a very small portion of the community that was actually that met with the applicant. No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying they never reached out to the community. The deal was they were going to let the community know what was going on. They never did that. Right. So, they may have reached out to a couple people, but they never got, if you're going to talk about a community, and this is a community board, the community had a right to know what was going on, and they do not know. We're not allowed to speak or how do you speak? We're not allowed. We're not Yes, we're not allowed to speak. We only take questions and comments from people on the board. But I I think we have to be clear that the applicant did believe they were talking to representatives of the community. It may not have been the full community according to some of our definitions, but I think they felt that they were reaching out as we requested. Okay. That was Yeah. But I'm saying that experience as a community member that did not happen and I feel that the community board needs to know that. Yes. Okay. All right. Sorry. Here the appointed community board six member and my first meeting was last month when this was I do recall there was accountability on both sides of the equation to meet separately separate from the bulk meeting separate from the full board. So I just want to make that be on record that that was the advice given that we were hardressed as a full board to vote on last month and that was the accountability on both sides. So not just on the owner it was also the community. So I just want to make sure that it's put in the notes. Right. And I believe you'll see that in our modification. We do acknowledge that there was as we requested there was me there were meetings between what we understood to be the community and the applicant. All right. I think the question's been called. Please let's vote on your ballot. While that's going on, Anton, do you have a do you have a report? And how many how many people on the June agenda? That's that's our next Okay, our next up we have Gabe Tupo is the chair of the Landerson Waterfront. Okay, we have two quick family-friendly non-controversial phase two is going to require the Patrick Brown walk to be closed. So, we are asking that some additional work be added to the scope of work. Patrick Brown walk has kind of decayed trellises, uneven bricks, there's graffiti, there's missing trash cans, there's missing benches. we're asking for all that to be remedied and graffiti-free surfacing to be added. Any questions? Nope. Call the question. Call the second. Okay. There since there's no objection, we'll now vote on the resolution. Please mark the digital ballot. Okay. We're asking to submit written testimony regarding the Freedom Plaza Casino, asking them to vastly expand the design, scope of work in the environmental impact study. This is a more fleshed out version of verbal testimony that I already gave. We're going to challenge them on a number of points to do a larger environmental impact study. The original one only wanted to look in a quarter mile. we want them to incorporate socioeconomic conditions, including things like gambling addiction and the prevalence of pawn shops near casinos. We asked them to look much deeper into traffic. The original proposal was grossly active but only looking at 11 intersections. We want to look at a lot of things including access of first a hospitals. we're concerned that their cooling method is going to be very disruptive. The east river ecosystem. We're worried about nor there's a a lot of interesting stuff. This resolution will give us the right to submit that testimony. Thank you. Any questions? Call questions. Thank Okay, please please please vote on on on the resolution and mark your digital ballot. Next up, we have Steve Perez who is currently vice chair of budget and governmental affairs. Resolutions from Okay, see question second. All right, please vote on the resolution and mark your digital ballot. Okay. that's for both both of the resolutions. Okay. And waving the report. So next up we're going to transportation which is Jason from chair. Thank you. Our first resolution up. We are discussing the 30 points bus. DT presented to the committee a detailed datadriven plan to improve bus speeds on 34th Street that would benefit 28,000 members of our community where the bus is on that street daily and dozens of others who move across the corridor each day. We listened to many members of the community's feedback. No new information was raised today that was not raised previously during the committee. The committee voted unanimously to recommend that we move forward with this plan. I want to address a call from the public session to delay the decision. I believe we should consider the following in considering the speed at which this project moves forward. Number one, level of impact. Number two, degree of certainty. Number three, risk of inaction or delay. And number four, risk of getting it wrong. One, level of impact. There's a high level of impact. There are 28,000 community members who ride the bus on the corridor daily. There is no subway alerting the corridor and buses of the only way across town. Two degree of 30 ft although high the 14th street way resulted in a 34% improvement in bus and no negative impact to neighboring streets or businesses. No study or model can provide data with 100% certainty. Real world data such as this offers a high level of confidence and a higher level than any model can provide. Number three, risk in action. Also, highly continue. If we fail to act, we will continue to fail the 28,000 members of our community who ride the bus on 34th Street on buses that travel at 3 to 5 miles per hour during rush hour. We will also continue to fail needs of others who would take the bus but now walk or take taxis or drive due to unreliable and slow bus service. And number four, risk of getting it wrong. This is slow. The proposed bus the proposed busy will be a quick be able to be quickly implemented and at low cost. The implementation will be primarily paint and street lines. If the project is a failure unexpectedly despite the available data that we have, it can be easily reversed. And thank you. We'll take questions. Rich. Yep. I just speak about this that I think I'm going to ask the permission of the group to call a question at this point. Second. Great. Okay. seeing if there's no objection, we will now vote on the resolution. Please mark your digital ballot. There is objection. Oh, sorry. U the question was called and seconded. No, I I objected I object the whole the whole plan. I I'm I'm sorry. You want to Can I lend a comment? Can I lend a comment? sure. We'll let you we'll let you comment and then we'll we'll vote. Okay, great. Okay. So, I just want to mention watching this meeting last week, the community did not have a chance at all because your minds were made up before the meeting even began. And again, when did the comm when did you reach out to the to the committee? When did you reach out to the community? When did the agency reach out to the community? When did the electives reach out to the community? As per the DOT, you know, Rachel's own words, 34th Street is not like 14th Street. It is very unique and it is a very important corridor. There is still monitor monitoring to see if this would work. data that should have been provided at this juncture still unanswered. But really what I'm concerned about mostly is the optics of your committee that it doesn't look good. The way you manipulated and rushed through the meeting, rushed through the resolution to get this to the full board meeting before the break before the community engagement before the community had a chance to do due diligence before research is complete. So it begs the question, what is the role of the community board when you have not engaged in the community? So this whole manipulative meeting that you had last week really begs the question. So, you know, it doesn't it does not look good on community board 6. And so I I ask that people reconsider this until we have more information, please. until we I'm not against faster transportation from one end to the other, but this is clearly a rush job and it it does not look good on us. Thank you. well, and we have Liz Liz Burr also has her hand on. Yeah, I just had a couple of questions. It was mostly about on the report from the DOT it they mentioned that there'll be a traffic analysis report that will handle dynamic traffic modeling and so I don't know if we know an ETA or did they already deliver that to us because it's just that they would re provide us results when it's done but I don't and we have we've been speaking with the DOT and they let us know that there will be a report they assume by the end of the month and that they will make a separate presentation to the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association that we are able to attend as well. Okay. But there will be a pres a specific presentation made to the Murray Hill Neighborhood Association. Okay. Thank you. And Jason, you'd like to respond to just very briefly. so we've been discussing a 30.3 buzzway for at least a year. In June 2024, we first passed a resolution asking for a busway on 34th Street. several months ago, we passed a resolution unanimously and the board approving PFD's or sorry asking specifically for a bus way after GFD presented a number of options for 34th Street. so there was ample opportunity for the community and the community board to object. There has no objection during there's one vote in objection to the first resolution we passed. The second resolution passed unanimously. No members of the community came to any of our committee meetings prior to the last week to fight an extensive opportunity for public right and you're still lacking a ton of data that you have don't have and they even admitted themselves it's ongoing it's ongoing it's not conclusive that it even works all that anyway I'm Sorry, we couldn't hear what you were saying, Michael. And do you have a question? No, I was just saying that, you know, you make these decisions on inconclusive analytics that they've admitted they do not have. It's ongoing work. You had a briefing in March and you decided to do this. I mean, you're not talking to the the people that live right in Murray Hill. You're not talking to them obviously because people have spoken about that and missing this this information. So Sandy, the question has been called this massive project that you're making a decision on. Anyway, I'm done. Thank you, Michael, for your comments and we will proceed to vote. The question has been called. Okay, moving on to the next item on the agenda for transportation. the next is a proposal from the department of transportation to implement a double best way on the southern portion of Madison Avenue only I think three or four blocks of extension on 34th Street. We saw dependent presucing place. this is a open street that existed in the last four years. We're recommending that we continue to allow the open street. Follow the question. All right. We'll now vote on the resolution. Please mark a digital ballot. All right. Next up, is the implement implementation of a double bus lane on Madison Avenue between East 23rd Street and East 42nd Street. Following the question. All right. Please. Second. Second. Let's proceed to vote. this is the next one is the complete street redesign of third avenue. Yeah. So, so yeah, lastly from we have a resision requesting that the city council passes legislation to require Wait, sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm not sure everybody's clear. the resolution in support of a complete street redesign on Third Avenue from 24th Street to 59th Street in Manhattan. We have been asking for a bike lane on Third Avenue for many years. We commissioned the study for bike lane on Third Avenue. DOT has finally presented a bike lane for Third Avenue within our district. It's a continuation of the bike lane on Third Avenue that exists on the upper east side just outside of our district. And are there any questions? Oh, question. Second. Second. And unfortunately, Jonathan Miles, who was very kindly seating his time, actually wanted to talk about this next issue. So, if we don't mind, we'll like to give him his three minutes. Jonathan, please go ahead. Thanks very much to everybody for permitting me the time here. and I know it's been a long meeting, so I'll give the very brief version of it. I'm a lawyer, a cyclist, and a pedestrian in District 6, and I'm speaking in favor of the resolution calling upon the New York City Council to enact legislation to mandate that cyclist traffic violations be treated as noncriminal sums. I share the frustration with cyclists traveling in the wrong direction, riding on sidewalks, and running red lights. They're all behaviors that obstruct others that have the right of way. But criminalization is not the answer. Proper enforcement and tickets is the answer. a few supporting facts. First, ebikes cause less than 0.5% of pedestrian injuries. Second, criminalization would expose a vulnerable New York City worker population to ICE enforcement, which we've seen recently at judicial hearings and even naturalization proceedings. And lastly, criminalization would pull police attention from the causes of 99.5% of pedestrian injuries as well as other public safety concerns. As criminal matters require more police time than simp simple traffic citations, police should be focused on true risk to safety and more significant nuisances like illegally parked cars blocking traffic and blocking visibility as well as the enforcement of traffic to keep car traffic flowing in our busy intersections in this district. Thanks very much. Yes. All right. if have we called this question yet? Thank you. Please mark your ballots. Thank you. All right. Health and environment Rub Kakad chair.
