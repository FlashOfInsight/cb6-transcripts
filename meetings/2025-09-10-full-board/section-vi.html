Final vote counts will be announced after the second roll call. If any part of our our voting procedure is unclear, please raise your hand and we will address your questions. Okay, first up, Anton Molner, chair of business affairs and licensing. This is what we get when we don't have board meetings during the summer. [Music]</p>
        <p>Three separate meetings we had this this summer. You know, business doesn't stop. License applications don't stop. DMT applications don't stop just because of the summer. So, we do meet. however, I'm going to try to make this as painless, as quick as possible. there there's like 573 of them. [Laughter] I think there's over a hundred.</p>
        <p>We just bundle everything. We don't know how you do it, Anton. We don't. We leave it up to you. I'm asked to resolution the bundle of numbers so we can get through this fairly quickly. June resolutions item A. this is for Monday alcohol events program which actually already took place. We have already said to the state liquor authority a notification that there was a precision done for this particular thing in the committee itself. I'd like to hear a resolution model BCD which are wine and liquor signing licenses for three different entities. There were no issues in terms of the committee saying okay to these</p>
        <p>move to bundle bundle</p>
        <p>bundle I think we can bundle more actually I'm actually wondering if we can't bundle pretty much everything at least of like kind even across months like can we bundle all the sidewalk cafes can we you know unless somebody has an issue with something I want to pull out. Can we do the roadway cafes, the sidewalk cafe, the liquor licenses? I think that would be good for my start. Yeah. Okay, sure. I'd like to resolution the bundle EF</p>
        <p>all the way through and these are all sky block and roadway cafes. Some of them require a lot of predictions, but the committee did vote on them in positive positive way. So, no issues there. Okay. I think we're ready to bundle. Yeah. Second. Yeah. To bundle.</p>
        <p>Yeah. Sorry, we can't we didn't catch I was attempting to second the motion that Ann made to bundle to bundle everything that was the same type of application. Is there anything you specifically want to pull out?</p>
        <p>not leg resolutions. she was saying across all months through Sure. No, we can do it. I have just two I'd like to bring to the board's attention. Okay. And this is for the July resolutions. W and Sim resolution recommending denial for Sidewalk Cafe for both Winsville and for pizza. we did invite the principles for both of them. they decided not to show up and based upon that and their application we felt it was best to deny their request. They didn't have enough interest in showing up for the meeting u the committee held that we're not going to show interest in them u getting half day license.</p>
        <p>excuse me. Was was was that July W and X?</p>
        <p>Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Anton. Okay. Do we have any objections? Absolutely. This includes everything including July Z and AA.</p>
        <p>Yes. I have questions about Z if I could. Okay. the cannabis work. There's a demand from the work and the roadway cafe license applications. I think what we're trying to do is address all the particular all the same type of applications. So we'll do cannabis after the</p>
        <p>not included in sorry confusion. Yeah. But like applications for sidewalk sidewalk and roadway cafes. Okay. Okay. call the question.</p>
        <p>Call the question. Okay. We can go ahead and vote on all the sidewalk and and roadway cafes, including the denials. Including the denials. Please go ahead and vote. That leaves us with</p>
        <p>Welcome back to June resolutions. wine, beer, and cider licenses for BC and D in June. Let's see where else we have wine beer and cider in July. And all of these were in favor? Yes. Okay, we'll go ahead and bundle all of those applications. One of your liquor applications.</p>
        <p>Okay, please go ahead and vote. Marty, thank you. I believe K lists 10 together. [Music] I'm I'm sorry I didn't catch that. I'm I'm K as a vendor from the presses listed together all one for alterations.</p>
        <p>they are all very timesensitive and they're all they were all no no objections. So the committee just put them together and we send them off to the SLA like that. Okay, I think we're on to cannabis now. And there were some questions on Y and Zed. Well, alterations. Oh, sorry. Okay.</p>
        <p>Okay. We have a bunch of them. No objection. The alterations. alteration may have to do with altering the liquor license so that they could serve alcohol on previously approved sidewalk or roadway cafes. Okay. Call a question. Okay, please go ahead and vote.</p>
        <p>Okay. Okay. Can applications Steuart had a question. Please go ahead. I have questions about the first of all, did you said that the owners didn't show up? Did anyone show up to represent the owner or no one showed up? We're talking about 98 and 100,000. Correct.</p>
        <p>First Avenue. Yeah. He came before us not before that and we didn't review it because he had an issue with whether the license was new or whether it was the transfer from a cannabis site that he had in Queens. So though we were apprised of what he really wanted to do, we didn't consider it. Then the next month, the Office of Canada's management decided to revamp its rules regarding distance and that put 998 and 1,000 in non-compliance with distance from schools and houses of worship. the applicant didn't show but he did send us something saying</p>
        <p>what was it I forgot for for the second month the applicant alerted us he would not be coming in light of the</p>
        <p>the change of interpretation of the district requirements. But he did he stopped short of fully withdrawing his application. So so as not to have nothing on the record, the committee decided to proceed with a resolution. So yes, we did deny or deny objection to his application. so we took seriously what the community said including the Celsius comments. same thing for the count application for the dispensary at 4132 second avenue. They didn't show but just looking at the distance applicate distance for the applicant that would have formed out of compliance with the new rules by the office of pend management. again to be on the record send resolution of no objection to this applicant.</p>
        <p>Well, I just want to raise a concern that you might be able to answer. I presume that the office candidates management rules went through the formal procedure and that the applicant at the time that he invested any Maloneyy or resources was following the existing rules. if that's correct and then the rules changed after he filed an application and after he invested. I think it's your concern that it's you know I mean this this has been a concern and it has gone up to the governor's office and the question is whether to grandfather these applications andor cannabis stores that are already in existence. I think it was 144 stores that foul with this new rule. So the question is whether the law will be changed whether be grandfathered is still up in Albany.</p>
        <p>Right. So, I don't know how far this applicant went through the process, but I would be concerned if the applicant found the signing lease and and has some financial commitments as a consequence of the representation of of the government by the old and an's going to respond to this actually. So, Stu, just so you know that we had concerns about that as well. but we had other issues with the application in terms of u transparency during the application process and the information that he was providing. So we weren't entirely thrilled with the application regardless of the OCM screw up in proximity reporting. So it it was not the only reason for our you know for our objections.</p>
        <p>It's interesting that in the Omatch manage crossivity report they did indicate a number of applications that were sent to us that they were not in compliance with the distance requirements. So sorry if you have a question just so two two questions for me. first would you mind covering just explaining the the controversy around the location exactly what the situation there is and what what being changed and corrected just for programs backing. So why why it doesn't meet the 500 foot rule? What what's the change that the state has made to the 500 rule and exactly why? What was the policy before and what is it now changed to?</p>
        <p>Wants to answer this, Anton, if you're all right with it. And she's in the back. It was a it was basically a change between doortodoor versus property to property line and the legislation was written. It was understood to be property line to property line but that is not how the rules for the proximity reports like how how the GPS worked. So that there were places that were legit you know door to door to door but not property line to property line and that's only relevant like these are state laws but it's it's it like if you're talking about you know Trumanburg New York it's not there's not that much of a difference but if you're in Manhattan it is. And that's why that's why half of the more than half of the the locations that are impacted by this are in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Does that make sense? It does.</p>
        <p>next I had a a comment related to Z. I believe that's the lost my place. Z's the 998 1000 First Avenue. Yes. See, see. Yes. Thank you. so this is the second time we've had a cannabis dispensary application for the board where one of the basises of our objection was that we liked the business that was in that location and we didn't want to see it replaced with a cannabis dispensary. The other one being stone 40th 45th 45th and second I I I I don't believe that the intention of the community board review of of Canada shops if the intent is for us to pick and choose which stores we want in our community. and I think we're overstepping our our authority and our ability to influence by trying to select which businesses we have in the community. We don't generally have that power. If a pharmacy wants to replace a convenience store, a grocery store wants to replace something else. That's not something the community board has purview over. and so I personally think it's inappropriate for us to oppose cannabis locations because we like the business that they would otherwise be taking over the space for.</p>
        <p>And see the discussion or watch the meeting and come and see the discussion. It makes it sound a lot more casual than it is. We go very much. Please Sarah.</p>
        <p>Wait, wait. Let's Sarah needs a microphone. M thank you for letting me speak because you know having been part of the business affairs and licensing committee I sit here you know I sit at the meetings and I watch what's going on and I will deal with the questions one at a time I guess and they may not be in order but with regard to the committee thinking that we're going to decide which you know doors we might keep and not keep. That's not what we're doing. We are looking at the applications as they come in. We are very importantly listening to the community that is in that you know area where the shops may be coming. so I wouldn't say that's not our focus and we spend a lot of time with looking at the spaces and the applications with regard to, you know, worrying or being concerned about licenses or leases, I should say, leases that these applicants have going on with, you know, the the landlord the one that we're talking about in this case at the last month's meeting gave us a little piece of paper with an intention to rent this building and we and thank you Ann because she is very much tuned into all of these pieces we asked him to please get a lease signed for us. We need assigned leaks. That's not unreasonable. And that's part of the application process. He came back to us this past month with the exact same piece of paper that he had last month, which was not formal and had a little, you know, scribble of whatever it was. But that's not appropriate for us to be, you know, looking at. This is not a legal document. So, you know, let's, you know, look at the two issues because yes, we did have our, you know, representative that spoke to us, on Zoom. Okay. You have to divide or separate the new applications based on the new rules out of, you know, management and those that already have their license. And they may have their license and it's not, you know, they're not in the distance because it's kind of you know as Dan said the boundaries and as the crow flies so you've got a lot of issues there and those need to be taken care of</p>
        <p>and in terms of leases the office of Canada management is very clear that it's a private transaction it's between let's say Flintstone and the landlord same thing in this situation 198 8 1 Avenue. By the way, 1,000 is a vacant store. 998 is the pharmacy and we took very seriously what the community members said. After all, we are representative of the community and there was a lot of objection whether a cannabis shop should be there at all. Not withstanding it would may or may not displace the pharmacy. Okay. Can we Sorry, Marty.</p>
        <p>Call the question. I was going to just say if there's no further discussion, let's please vote. Please mark your ballots. Oh, I want to make a quick comment. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, I mean this has been a moving</p>
        <p>target. you know especially given the incompetence of the office of management fund and we've been feeling our way through this you know and trying to understand what role our community board plays in listening to the community and it's not it hasn't been an easy process and I just welcome people to to attend our meetings because you'll see as an said and Sarah said that we agonize over these things it's not like said we don't like this guy, you know. So, I just hope that I'll be quiet with a long agenda.</p>
        <p>Thank you. Let's vote on these resol these resolutions. Sir license. resolution of objection for new cannabis application retail dispensary license at 436 second Avenue and this falls in the same situation we had. their prior applicants. They don't abide by the newly interpreted rules regarding existence. Aside from the fact not only from schools and houses of worship but also other cannabis applicants at the same time. so I'd like to call the question on the candidates application. Great. Please please mark their digital</p>
        <p>ballots. And I think that's it. Adam and August item A as well. wanted to add some live music. We had no problem with that. And MC Kips, which has the bar selling wine and liquor, wanted to also sell aside wine and beer, also wanted to sell liquor. We had an update to show you that question.</p>
        <p>Call the question. Okay. And do you have a report, Anton? Yeah, it's gonna take about half an hour. Okay. Sorry. Sorry. Gloria Gloria has her hand up. Are we going? Are we done with</p>
        <p>resolutions? We're still going through We're done with the resolutions. Question. Oh, sorry. 24 diner. Which number is</p>
        <p>the sidewalk cafe? Did you get the reference? 21st August. What letter? What day? August. N N. So, they're a 24-hour diner and we're okaying a sidewalk cafe. So, I'm just curious, is that sidewalk cafe open 24 hours?</p>
        <p>No, it's not allowed. No. No. Okay. Okay. All right. Anton, your report. Well, interestingly, we received a notification from DOT that we cannot turn down a request from an applicant for sidewalk or roadway cafe simply because they didn't show up at the meeting.</p>
        <p>There had to be more reasons than that. second, we've already talked about the confusion with the cost management on distance regulations. Hopefully all those cannabis dispensaries that are currently opening that are foul of the new distance regulations will be able to continue their business. Depends on the governor. And next week we will be meeting not to discuss applicants but to talk about trying to more make our committee more efficient and to educate newer members on some of the rules and regulations that we have to abide by for SLA and do applications. So, certainly other people are welcome to attend that meeting, but it's really meant to be for committee members to give their opinions of how we can speed up the process.</p>
        <p>Great. Thank you. Shorter than a bulk meeting. So, actually down from four hours to three hours. You're you're up, Neil. Go ahead. We're</p>
        <p>Yes. parks, landmarks, and cultural affairs fairs. Hope everyone had a nice summer. We had really good meeting. 26 members of the public were in attendance at the office and we also had four board members who attended Kevin O'Keefe Larry Shorso and Michael Cohen. So we appreciated you know their participation. So the first resolution will it be the dog room or public restrooms is the first one. Okay. So it be the restroom. Okay.</p>
        <p>We're not going to put it on. Do you want to put there are some alterations to that? I don't know if everybody saw the changes to the rest. We just have one pulling it up now. So we'll show that. Yeah. Simple. Is it right that Let me see if I can do full screen. Just close the participants panel.</p>
        <p>Yeah, close out. There we go. That should be better. Okay. So, all that is fine. That's the same. Can you just scroll down to the bottom? The amendment part. This does not have the amendments. I can send it to No, it's</p>
        <p>the one that's on the reso background. Sorry about that. No, read it out loud and mute. Oh, okay. Sure. Therefore, therefore resolve that Manhattan board. Sorry, it's all in red and it says draft. So, it's tough to read. Result that Manhattan Community Bo 46 supports the proposal for a new public restroom and North Brothers playground, but requests that a more appropriate exterior design be created to reflect the location's character. So, that's the Yes, you need the microphone. Sorry. I don't have a problem with the amendment and in fact I think the whole reszo is great. We need more restrooms. We also need more water fountains and you know they both take plumbing. I know that Gail Brewer just got through a res through the city council for Maloneyy or in the budget. I can't tell you details, but for more Maloneyy for water fountains in and around parks and I wonder if that's something that you have kind of taken into account. I mean, is it have not</p>
        <p>does it have a water fountain? Is that the question? Water. It does have a water fountain. So, thank you.</p>
        <p>Thanks, Mark. Right outside. Yeah. Great. Okay. Any more any discussion on Oh, sorry, Jenny. I had a quick quick question, Neil. So,</p>
        <p>we had the conversation in the parks committee. I was very supportive and the exterior of the bathroom didn't come out and not that I have a problem with it, but I'm just wondering how it came that this amendment was drafted. So we just we had looked at it again and just you know general overview and someone I guess we did a comparison of what it looked like to other you know restroom facilities. And so we just thought that perhaps it would be closer you know it could have a better design that could you know I guess like a look as nice as the other restrooms around the island. So that's all good. Thanks. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Kevin had a question. Thank you. Just quickly to Ann's point you said water fountains. it's the mandate now for the parks department to also have water bottle fillers. not just water bounds every time they put in a new water unit which I think is right. Thanks Kevin. any more comments or can we vote on</p>
        <p>this resolution? Okay, let's go ahead. Please mark your digital ballot. Okay, we can move along to the end. So, there any questions about this one? Yes. Thanks. I was just wondering if this</p>
        <p>proposed section for the smaller dolls, is that within the existing footprint or is it going to be kind of additional space that's taken from the other parts of the park? Oh, it would be additional space, but right now there's nothing going on in that space. It's just open, that's all. Okay. But yeah, but no, but you know what I mean as in it's not taking away like something from playground or Kate can also add to that because he's very familiar with it where exactly it's located above your cell.</p>
        <p>Yeah, it's actually idle. It was the former dog park and now it is just fenced off and it's growing mushrooms and dirty and not being used and not even allowed to be used. Got it. Yeah. I guess my just question would be like it could be used for something else though then. Yes. Yes. If it's not used for anything now. Okay. If there's no more discussion, we'll go. We didn't have anyone else from the community state anything as and to use it for something different. But we did have 26 people who were very adamant about adult run and they have 97 people in total in their ranks who really want adult run who are ready to volunteer. So you know they came out in force.</p>
        <p>Okay. Please let's vote on this resolution. Rock your digital ballots. And you have a report. Yeah. Yes. Let me just report. Okay, I'm happy right here. So, next month for the meeting we will have a member of the community will present about an update to a landmark building in the district and so we look forward to that. We'll also have some discussion about the LPC landmark preservation commission trying to you know say the acronym so that everyone I remember I had no idea what was going on DBC and the only was the NYPD I think</p>
        <p>so so we'll have that and then I also I just wanted to note that we do have three new members of the committee. Daniel Bernstein, that was his first meeting and he volunteered to take minutes. Yay, Daniel. [Laughter]</p>
        <p>we also had Shua Yao. Okay. She had really good questions. And, we also had Sandro Sherrod, former board member, join the committee as well. Former board. So they had three. Okay, that's it. Okay. Transportation. Jason from</p>
        <p>Good evening. tonight we've had a resolution regarding redesign of the ferry system. the main just right quickly we're in support of the proposed changes to fair system routes. the major changes affecting CB6 are that the Rockaway road would be extending from the Bronx to Rockway which means that there will be access to Rockway from 34th Street and Sky stops. whereas today that line only to Rockway only runs from 11. there's some other in stops and the Rockways. and there's also a proposal to introduce stops. so having fewer stops and the east river route so that create a more direct connection to 11 street from street. and so yeah, we're proposing to support the changes. we also made some comments and requests and some just general feedback on them including asking for half the day and restrooms and social</p>
        <p>the second wait for the mic please. Sorry. The second whereas written is somewhat subjective rather than objective. You can by eliminating 12 words and adding one it becomes more fact-based. that being</p>
        <p>a friendly amendment. It would be a friendly amendment. after the word after the 34th street eliminating eliminating can be can be a confusing and challenging experience for intended passengers due to just adding in healing. In other words, you know, boarding a ferry on East 34th Street includes long waits between schedule, etc., etc. It makes it fact based rather than some an opinion. This is an amendment to your proposing, right? Okay.</p>
        <p>What What line is this? Line 17 starting with the word can which is after street. Okay. And and then on line 18 ending with the word to as in due to and then including the word includes rather than you're you're suggesting strike these</p>
        <p>and put in the word includes. The boarding a ferry at East 34th Street includes long waits between scheduled departures. Okay. Do we need to vote on that? There's no if there's no great objection.</p>
        <p>If there's no objection, we can say it's a unanimous approval. Okay. All right. With that amendment, was there anything else? Okay. With that amendment, can we now vote on this resolution, please? Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry,</p>
        <p>this is great. This new ferry map. I just wanted to add another great thing for CB6 that there's going to be a route from 34th Street to Governor's Island. So, in addition to Great. Okay. All right. Please vote. And since this is our last resolution, you can now submit your digital ballot. have a brief report while you're</p>
        <p>doing that. over the summer, DRT installed concrete extended curves on Second Avenue between 20 and 18 Street. we had asked for this in April 2023. so it took a little while, but I'm glad to see that finally implemented. it was the concern around the intersections that were frequently parked in areas that were intended to be daylight. So now car which is great. and we heard from DOT last night that they will be implementing the protected bike lane on Third Avenue north of 15th Street that we passed a resolution in support of before the summer. They'll be implementing that before the end of this will start implementation before the end of this month. That's all. Thank you.</p>
        <p>And I might add that the meeting that was proposed with the Murray Hill Neighborhoods Association will happen. It has not happened yet, but they are working towards that. That was one of the issues that came up at our June June meeting. all right, health and environmental kakad chair. We're having our meeting tomorrow. We're going to have a presentation from Dora and then after that we're going to discuss budget requests about the budget request. I just want to thank Marie for helping me out and walking me through and answering a bunch of my questions over the summer. So, thanks for your help, Marty. And I also want to we have two new members, Liz Bur and Cat Valero. So, welcome to the committee. Okay. Land Juice and Waterfront, Gabe Turzo. Okay. We're going to have a very interesting meeting coming up in September. We're going to have a presentation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to discuss the city's water supplies and aquafer health. we we asked for that. It's going to be very interesting. We're may be on the schedule. It's</p>
        <p>we're working on it.</p>
        <p>We're working on it. we're going to be discussing the lost beds at the Mount Si Beth Israel. We're going to have something in the books, something proactive. so I highly recommend anyone who's interested in that attend. And then the the meat of the meeting is going to be a discussion on the faith-based affordable housing act. And we're going to really get into the weeds on this. we're going to ask questions like why religious institutions, why not any nonprofit? exactly which housing rules are being fasttracked and how and if these processes are so vorous, why don't we fasttrack all housing applicants? so we're going to look at all of this. we also have a new member who might be taking minutes here, Daniel Bstein. So I I encourage everybody who has any questions about this to attend or if you can attend and if you're curious about anything particularly the the housing act email me and I will try to address it in the meeting. Thank you. Any questions?</p>
        <p>So the the waterfront greenway recent years it's just still a mess. You can't there's a bin you still can't cross it. last time went there. Any kind of update because you know it's how long is it going to be? It's we have to wait till like 2015 because this is New York. This is they're going to build they're going to build an outer board walkway around similar to what they did from 53rd Street to the 59th Street Bridge connecting to the EPA going up. They're going to be building a outboard walkway that'll be over the water that'll bypass the pinch point.</p>
        <p>Yeah. When is another story? When is there another story? But I I've</p>
        <p>spoken to the construction people who had finished with Susco Park and I asked them specifically about that and they told me what they were going to be doing. It's like 7.3 times a day. I hear why is the west side so nice and the east side is just trash and I don't know question DGC has this on the books and we can reasonably conservatively expect it by the end of the decade is a huge barrier it actually is not we're not the barrier at No, leave it</p>
        <p>alone. And yeah, let let's let's not we're working on it. We're trying to get the the east side to be as good as the west side. So, let's let's move on. budget affairs and budget and government affairs. Rashma Patel. thank you, Sandy. we are having our monthly meeting this month on September 30th, which is actually our October meeting, and that is a public meeting on the budget. And I'm glad to hear Rupal that you guys are discussing budget requests at your next meeting. If everybody can have their request in before the 30th that would be great because after that we can't add or change anything after the public meeting because we're going to start preparing our submission. and that's it. And welcome to the new members. we have two new members on our committee. I because I'm in transit, I cannot remember the names unfortunately right now. But</p>
