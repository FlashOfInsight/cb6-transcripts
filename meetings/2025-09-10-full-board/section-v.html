        <p>the minutes from the June 11th full board meeting were distributed to board members ahead of time by the board office. If there is no objection, we will adopt the minutes as drafted. Board members, if you object to adopting the minutes, you may raise your hand. Seeing no objections, the minutes from the June 11th full board meeting are adopted. They will soon be available on the CB6 website. chair's report. This month's minutes show the attendance from this year's full board meetings and how each individual voted on the resolutions from the June meeting. please take a look at the most recent minutes that you were sent. So, you can go back to previous minutes to see how how the board voted on any resolution. And I'm not sure that people realize this that it is public information how you vote. So, don't be shocked if someone approaches you and says, "Why did you vote that way?" it's it's all it's all documented. And also, just wanted to point out that unless you attend the meeting in person, you don't count towards quorum. everyone who's here realizes that and realizes the benefit of coming together as a group and unfortunately we can't all do that always. But unless you unless you are not attending the meeting due to a disability, you will not count to quorum. and it's very important that we have a a quorum at our committee meetings. Otherwise, we cannot vote on the resolutions. We we do go ahead and meet, but you cannot vote. So again, it's this is more for the people that aren't here probably and certainly we know with a disability people cannot attend. That's totally understood. it's been a busy summer. First thing, our FDR proposal received a resolution of support from Civotas early in the summer. the burough president stole my description of the Solar One grant opening. but yeah, it's a great facility and great programs. We actually voted resolutions on it in support in 2008 as well as in 2013. And we've already we've always been a strong partner. I think actually there's a resolution in front of us tonight that allowed us to have a champagne toast yesterday. another huge achievement on our waterfront is the opening up of the space at East 34th Street and the FDR. This space will no longer be a parking lot.</p>
        <p>The East River is visible. Using this as public space has been the goal of the board for many years. And a huge thank you to our past chairs, many who fought very hard to get this to happen. and to Keith Powers who finally pushed us over the edge, and the EDC, who helped negotiate this as part of the Spark agreement, and the parks department who's going to take care of the park in the future, also contributed some monies towards it. They all work together to make this happen and, there will be a celebration, so stay tuned. We're not sure how we're going to celebrate, but we will do that. so the community advisory committee review of the casino applications is underway. It closes September 30th. please submit your testimony to the New York State Gaming Commission regarding the proposed locations. they have a very robust website and you can make a comment on any location in the city. It's completely, you know, we're all New Yorkers. We all have a say. their their website covers everything about all of these proposals. all right. In accordance with section 3A of the CB6 bylaws, I've appointed an elections committee. The elections committee will be running the election for CB6 officers that will take place in November. For more details on the duties of this committee and the election process, please refer to the CB6 bylaws found on the CB6 website. I have appointed Marian Roth, Maya Donahghue, and Omar Kershi to serve on the elections committee. Miriam Roth will will serve as the chair of this committee. Miam will now say a few words about the election process.</p>
        <p>Very few return engagement. Yeah. if anyone is interested in running for any position on the executive committee, please submit your nomination a self nomination or nomination of another member to the board office at info@c6.org by Wednesday, September 24th. After this date, nominations can only be made on the floor at our October 2025 meeting. If there are any questions, please submit them to info@cb6.org who will then forward all inquiries to the elections committee. And again, that's me, Maya, and Omar. as a reminder, the committee serves to oversee the technical process of the election and to ensure compliance with our board's bylaws. We are not consultants for anyone's candidacy. And there there are two questions that came up often last year. So I just wanted to try to help answer them and especi for those who aren't familiar with the process. each word office has a one-year term. And so that means anyone interested in any office right now can nominate themselves or someone else. And those positions just so you all have them are chair, first vice chair, second vice chair, sec Oh, second vice chair twice, sorry. Chair, first vice chair, second vice chair, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, and assistant treasurer. So just know that every position is available if you all would like to and I encourage you to do so, especially the new folks. Thank you. And just to comment, we have two open positions currently. We do not have an assistant treasurer and we do not have a second vice chair.</p>
        <p>Question vice chair. Second vice chair. That position is empty. Any questions? We encourage everyone to run. Yes, we have a democracy.</p>
        <p>Everyone. All of us. Yeah, anybody who wants to. Oh, dear Lord. And one thing, once you do serve on the executive committee, you will be asked to join the executive committee meeting, which is the Monday after full board or Wednesday, Wednesday after full board. Okay. Be</p>
        <p>Dishman will now give the treasures report. Thank you, Sandy. So, according to the Crystal report for August 2025, our budget for the fiscal year is 622,73, which is only 1.6% over what it was last fiscal year. And let me remind everyone that last fiscal year was extremely tight and with this budget this year, we expect it to be even tighter. the amount that I just quoted of 622073 includes our street fair Maloneyy which is 140,311 and that Maloneyy becomes even more significant for us as the budgets get tighter. So we do have a resolution that says that Maloneyy can be used for board activities and certainly we used a little bit of it this past fiscal year. So we have encumbered already and liquidated Maloneyy of 237,526 and the largest percentage of that is rent at 178,701. So the unencumbered Maloneyy that we have left is 384,546 including the street fair Maloneyy. So I just want people to realize that the office including Jesus and people have to look very closely at what other than personal services is spent on because there really is not a lot of flexibility in our budget and I just want to make people aware of that. Sandy I'll take any questions.</p>
        <p>Do we have any questions for our treasur? No we don't have any. Thank you be</p>
        <p>you're welcome.</p>
