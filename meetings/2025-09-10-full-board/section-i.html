        <p>Okay. Oh, here we are. Oh, here we go. All right. Yeah, just a moment. He meant July, August.</p>
        <p>There was no We are ready to go. Alex. Okay. Welcome to the September 10, 2025 full board meeting of Manhattan Community Board 6. My name is Sandy McKe and I'm the chair of CB6. This meeting is called to order at 7:05 p.m. Tonight we are joined by first vice chair John Keller, district manager Jesus Perez, assistant district manager Brendan Berth, and community coordinator Brian Laughaferty. New York New York state law requires all community board members who are not able to attend the meeting in person to have their cameras on and their first and last names displayed from the time the meeting is called to order until the time the meeting is adjourned. So, welcome back everyone. Hope you had a good summer break. and now a reminder of how we conduct our meetings. Do not speak until granted the floor. Please raise your hand and wait for me to recognize you. It is important that only one person speaks at a time so that members of the public watching at home can understand what is being said. You will be given a microphone if you are recognized to speak. The chat function should not be used for CB6 business or questions about agenda topics. Members of the public, if you wish to give remarks during the public session and have not already registered by filling out a form, you can register to speak in the public session on Zoom by using the Q&A feature and posting your name, your affiliation, and what specific topic you wish to speak about. Or if you are here in person and want to speak in the public session, you need to fill out our public speaker form, which is near the signins for the CB6 newsletter. This needs to be done by 7:15. The agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office, was posted online, and appears on the screen before you. If there is no objection, we will adopt the agenda as stated. Board members, if you object to adopting the agenda, you may raise your hand. Seeing no objections, the agenda for tonight's meeting is adopted. Jesus will now take attendance. All right, welcome back everyone. when I call your name, please indicate that you are present.</p>

        <p>here. Thank you. All right, with 28 members Julie present, we do have our elected officials sent in their reports ahead of time and they are compiled on the CB6 website. The link to the reports was sent out ahead of time and for your convenience can be found in the chat on Zoom or by going to our our website's page for full board meetings. I will call on each of the elected officials who have RSVPd so they can take questions from CB6 members and the public about their presubmitted reports. Each elected official will be able to field questions. And if there are no questions, we will move to the next elected official on our list. If the elected official has t has a time-sensitive matter to report on that didn't make it into their presubmitted report, they will have three minutes to do so. first on our list, we have Senator Krueger. Welcome.</p>
        <p>Good evening, everyone. Thank you for allowing me to be here with you. And I gather I'm not supposed to present. I'm just supposed to let you ask questions, which I'm always happy to answer. We did a very detailed update for the community just about a week ago. trying to keep us up to date with all the changes from the Trump administration and the impacts on us and so many things happening. I guess one thing I didn't put in that document and I'll stop there is I am actually not one of the New Yorkers running for Congress Congress since Jerry Nler has announced that he is not going to run again. So just if that's one of your questions, I can just answer that for you. Not me. I'm sticking around in the state senate till you fire me. And now I'm happy to answer questions.</p>
        <p>Are there any are there any questions for the senator? And if there's anything else you want to tell us, we're happy to hear. Well, I guess the one thing I would point out because of the Supreme Court decision yesterday on ISIS powers to collect up people under very strange circumstances, including if they seem to speak with an accent or do not have white skin. I'm telling people, one, make sure you're always carrying your documents with you, no matter where you're going, to show that you have status to be here in this country. never leave home without it frankly now which is disturbing but I think it's just an honest analysis and since apparently they're also concerned about people who are speaking another language I'm really bad at other languages but I'm going to practice a few sentences so that when they stop me I speak non-English and see what happens to me I'll stop there</p>
        <p>any any other questions for the senator right thank thank you very much oh I'm sorry tomorrow We're having the first of our senior roundts, older New Yorkers roundts, and the theme is actually on advocacy and what you can do. And that also seems appropriate to remind people of based on everyone's conversations right now. What do we do? So, you should have gotten that information in our newsletter or if you get my emails and you're more than welcome to jump on board. And of course, I want to give a shout out to Wendy Brennan who's here also. and who handles pretty much all of the webinars and older New Yorkers issues. Thank you. Now I'll shut up. Thanks.</p>
        <p>Great. Thank you so much. next on</p>
