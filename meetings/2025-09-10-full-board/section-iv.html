      <div id="transcript" class="content-panel">
        <p>our list, we have Assembly Member Alex Bores. it's great to be with you. I hope everyone had a wonderful summer. I'm going to start with a personal update which is three weeks ago my wife and I had our first child. and so Oh, thank you. So I am I am mostly on leave and I'm certainly avoiding indoor events until my son develops an immune system and gets vaccinated. but I I know this is the first meeting for a while, so I did want to hop on and just quickly share some updates and say hi to all of you. I want to start the actual non-personal update with an acknowledgment of the violence that we saw today where we had an action of political violence and we had a school shooting happening simultaneously in the same time zone. this on the heels of a horrific attack in Lizen's district about a month ago on at 345 Park gun violence is continuing to affect this country and while there's a lot that we can do at the state level, we will need federal action in order to make a difference there. But at the state level, this is an update that's been shared prior by both me and Senator Krueger, but but I think today of all days is worth reiterating is that the state in the budget invested $347 million to strengthen the Office of Gun Violence Pro Protection sorry, the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which is especially important because the White House Office of Gun Violence Protection was shut down. and the state needs to take a leading role in making sure that we can keep our citizens safe. I separately have bills on the use of smart guns and on banning 50 caliber weapons. these are among a package of bills that I'm hoping we were able to take up in the next session. Additionally, at the very end of last session, just after your your June meeting, the assembly and senate on the same day passed my raise act which provides comprehensive protections on extreme risks from AI development. if signed by the governor, it'd be the first bill in the country to regulate this. since then, California might be jumping ahead and trying to get that done ahead of time, but we're in ongoing conversations with the governor about how to get her to yes on this bill that 84% of New Yorkers support. In the meantime, some of the few tech titans that oppose it just last week, created a new super PAC where they said they're going to spend a hundred million dollars on advocating against any AI regulation at the state level focused on just four states, California, Ohio, Illinois, and of course, New York. so they are spending a lot of Maloneyy to stop anything sensible from going forward. and we think it's really important that the governor and all elected officials here that while New Yorkers are very pro- innovation, that's not a blank check. We need to be kept safe from some of these aspects as well. lastly, I want to just a few upcoming events or services that are new in the office. first is that we're going to be hosting another shred truck event at our district office on October 9th from 9:00 a.m. to noon. our office again at 353 Lexington Avenue. So Lexington and 40th Street. And over the summer we introduced for the first time notary services. So we offer free notary in our office from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday. bring in any documents want you want notorized and we're very happy to do so. and with that I really appreciate your time and listening and happy to answer any questions that people have. and Seligman has a question.</p>
        <p>Can you wait for the microphone, please? Sorry, he won't hear you. I'll ask the question that Liz</p>
        <p>preempted. I've also seen your name taged as a possible candidate for Jerry Nery. Are you considering it? I have heard that I've seen my name mentioned as well. I have been very humbled by people asking that question. I I am I am not ruling it out at the moment. I'm pretty focused on my three and a half week old son. but I think that's a question to be answered in due time. Do we have any other questions for our assembly? Great. Thank you. Well, enjoy your</p>
        <p>evening with your son and thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah. next we have Mackie Bentley from Congressman Nadler's office. good evening everyone. Sorry.</p>
        <p>the only thing I want to highlight for my report which was mentioned by Senator Bor is that Congressman Ner will not be seeking reelection next year. he is very grateful and humbled to be able to serve New York's 12th congressional district for 32 years. and while he is not seeking reelection, our office will still be here for any federal casework issues or any community issues and the congressman will be in office so can the community strong and for these next 16 months. so that's all I wanted to highlight. I'm happy to take any questions. Do we have any questions for M? Great. Thank you very much. next we have Christian Williams from the mayor's office.</p>
        <p>Do we have Oh, it's it's Charmaine. I think I saw something in the chat saying no update. So, Oh, okay. So, no updates.</p>
        <p>No updates from the mayor's office. Okay. Thank you. next we have Payton Schultis from C Senator Gonzalez's office. Hi, report but happy to take any questions. Any questions for the senator's office? Okay, great.</p>
        <p>next we have Joanna Sanchez from Assembly Epsteinin's office. Hello everyone. I hope everyone enjoyed their summer. so our updates are that we have our upcoming movies in the park. I hope anyone our constituents could join us there. In addition, we have a senior legal planning workshop to plan healthc care proxies and powers of attorney that will be on Monday, October 20th. additional information is in in the newsletter and if anyone has any further questions or concerns I will drop my information in the chat. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Any questions? Great. Thank you very much. Next we have Pat Hill from Council</p>
        <p>Member P's office. Good evening everyone. Hope everyone's doing well and had a great summer. I don't have anything to add to our report and I know it's pretty lengthy, but if anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask. Do we have any questions for the council member? No. Okay, great.</p>
        <p>Thank you. All right, next we have Spencer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from the office of council district 2. Hi, good evening everyone. I hope everyone had a good summer. I also don't have much to share other than as you may have heard that at the end of the month of August, council member Rivera resigned from her seat. the council district 2 office is still open. We still have staff in it. you can email the same email district 2@consil.nyc.gov for any constituent case work. We're still going to community board meetings and we'll continue to operate the office until the next council member takes a seat. So happy to take any questions, but that's all I have.</p>
        <p>Do we have any questions?</p>
        <p>All right, great. We're really moving through our list. Sorry. and I think we are do we have Oh, do we have anyone else on our electedance list? I know we're waiting for the burough president to attend in person, I believe. Is that correct? So when he comes we'll we'll segue back to him. has anyone signed up to speak in the public session? So just hold on. we have two people who've suddenly come on. Curtis Young. Okay.</p>
        <p>From the public advocates office. Curtis, please go ahead. Curtis, give him a second. Okay. Good. Good evening, CB6. I just want to say welcome back. We are looking forward to another invigorating fall season of community board meetings. I don't have any additional updates. Just want to send my greetings from the public's office. Look forward to being there in person next month. Thank you. Hey, thank you. Do we have any questions for the public? No. Great. Thank you very much. We have one last agency. We have Daryl</p>
        <p>Cochran from the city's Human Rights Commission. Daryl, are you online there? Great. I am. Yes. Hi. Thank you so much. and it was good to see Curtis. We were former members of Community Board 12 way uptown. But I'm with the New York City Commission on Human Rights. We are the city agency that protects against discrimination. we come to each community board every so often. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm the director of the Manhattan Community Relations Team. And our agency, if you do not know, we're the agency that looks to protect New Yorkers against discrimination in areas of employment, housing, areas of public accommodation. We often work with community boards when it comes to making sure there's sidewalk access if there's any bias incidents in the community. we are definitely a resource for that sort of thing. And our main office in in lower Manhattan is at 22 Reed Street and you could walk in at any time at that peri at Monday through Friday 9:30 to 4:30 I believe. And so you know I just want to let you know that we're here as a resource for you. If someone if you experience discrimination or someone you know you could reach out to 212416197 or you could visit our website at nyc.gov/human rights. So thank you so much.</p>
        <p>Great. Thank you. Do we have questions? Any questions? All right. No. Thanks very much. I think now we are ready to move on to the public session.</p>
        <p>All right. the first person on the list is Charles Coutino, president of the Southern Area Community who wishes to speak to the board on a matter relating to a resolution that we've got on a cannabis application for 998 through 1000 First Avenue. Mr. Coutino or Dr. Coutino, I believe you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin your remarks now. Are you there? Shouldn't be able to unmute himself. Sir, you'll have to unmute yourself. Well, it looks like the burough president is just joining us. So, while we give Dr. Coutino some time to sort out his audio issues, we will hear from the burough president, Manhattan Burough President.</p>
        <p>Our burough president, welcome so much. Well, CB6 looks like I came in right on</p>
        <p>time. How you make an interest in this business? I know you've heard this before. describe that my my outrage, my anger, my deep sorrow at the murder of Charlie Kirk is not about politics. It's about a an escalating cycle of political violence which is a cancer which spreads and we simply need to denounce it. We need to stop this. We need to stop all gun violence. We need to stop easy access to guns in this country. We need to resolve our differences through peaceful means. I want to get that on the record. Now, can I move on to a happier topic? I got to cut the ribbon yesterday on a wonderful new capital project right here at CB6. Soul One has finally opened down by Peter Cyrus and Cove. Do you guys know about this project? Yes, it took 20 years. You probably had 12 hearings on it. It came out beautifully. For those who don't know, this is right on the water at about 23rd Street. It's by this wonderful nonprofit that's going to provide environmental education for young people, career access, career training, job fairs, and more for adults in green technologies and the environmental sciences. Training for teachers and public schools to teach environmental science all right there on the waterfront. And the building itself is an incredible example of resiliency. this is of course an area that flood in the Sandy. is got its own solar power so it can survive off the grid in case there's a power outage. It is elevated all the building systems can keep operating even in the midst of the catastrophic storm and has got many many other beautiful features designed by a star architect Bure Engel. So what a great message for young people to see this. So go check it out. We opened it yesterday. I I got to commend community states on a couple things. you have been leading on on reinvisioning street transportation. I know you've doubled down on support for the 34th Street Pathway. I'm really excited about this. I know it wasn't easy. any kind of street redesign. A plug for that. We we support it. Mildly path. And I also share this board's love of fairies, which I see at this point an absolutely essential piece of our transportation network. It could be even better. And I think you're working on Wow, this is like now to bring you with me to all my events, man. Awesome. You like fairies, too. I know you keep a tight agenda here, so I I just want to very I'll mention very quickly before I wrap up. I imagine the topic of casinos are on your mind.</p>
        <p>pity me. Yes. In my burrow. and of course I have I have a seat on the the community advisory council. you're not going to hear any defended state in front of me right now because I'm playing a little more cautiously. But I want you to know I have heard probably from thousands of people in community board 6 in the surrounding areas overwhelming probably 90% plus opposition. I can tabulate it. I hear you. I've internalized your concerns. Know that I hear you. You come through loud and clear. I didn't know if the board took a position. I think you did early on. Right. debating</p>
        <p>definitely heard from board members and</p>
        <p>I've heard from neighbors and residents and small businesses. So message received. I'll leave you with that. Stay tuned. finally Hispanic Heritage Month. I know we have so much to celebrate. yes indeed. And we're doing our big annual celebration on September 20 25th 25th. do you guys like to go up town? You can come on to the Sugar Hill Children's Museum. It's incredible. On 155th, the evening of September 25th, you know what time we're 6 p.m. So come along out for Hispanic Heritage Month. Thank you very much. Thank you so much.</p>
        <p>Wait, do you have any questions? Question or two? Yes, sir.</p>
        <p>Every year, wait for the mic, please, Martin. Every year we lose between five and 10 members. actually in two years I among 10 others who will be turned out so we'll be down about 20 people at that time so half the board various borrow presidents over the years said oh yes I will add more people during the year as you lose people it's very difficult to run committees when you have minus individuals</p>
        <p>there. I know there's a there's been a waiting list. You know, every year you go through about 900 or so people to put on the boards. There are people waiting to come on. Yes. So, if and when there is an open, we'd appreciate a point. I believe one opening on CB6. Sorry if I have that wrong. We we lost two people tonight. I didn't know about it.</p>
        <p>You found it. Okay. So, that makes a three vacancies. Is that correct? Two. Okay. one previously announced and one announced tonight. Okay. is that person who's retiring here that I can thank them for their service?</p>
        <p>I hope not. Send my hex. I hear you. we are already because we are aware of one. We already I believe have tapped someone for that. Not sure if that's been publicly announced yet, but we were all over that one. And I'll make sure the team expedites the second one. I hear you. Quorum's tough. We don't need to make it even tougher with vacancies. So, we'll make sure we get you two good people right away. Right. Thank you so much, C6. Did you have a question? You do the next grand of applause. Thanks, guys. Enjoy. Goodbye.</p>
        <p>Okay, we'll try we'll go back to the public session. Charles Coutino one last time. Are you with us or are you you are with us but are you able to enable your mic? All right, we'll go on to the next speaker then. the next speaker is Pam Zius also from Southern Area Community who wishes to speak on the cannabis application for 998 through 1000 first app. Miss Zanzias, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now.</p>
        <p>Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Wonderful. Good evening, chair and members of community board 6. My name is Pamela Zzas, vice president of Sutton Area Community. I'm here on behalf of our neighborhood residents and local businesses to express strong opposition to the proposed cannabis dispensary at 998 and 10001st Avenue. There are several clear and critical reasons why this location is inappropriate and under state law likely ineligible. One, the proximity to a licensed school just steps away at 357 East 55th Street is the Monasuri School of New York. Under New York State cannabis regulations, specifically 9CRR119.4 Four, retail dispensaries cannot be loc located within 500 ft of a school based on standard block measurements and available mapping. The proposed site falls well within that prohibited zone. Two additional nearby child care facility, New York Kids Club. Direct directly across the street from 998 1st Avenue is New York Kids Club Sutton Place, a wellestablished daycare and preschool. Every weekday, children and families actively use the sidewalks and crosswalks in front of the proposed dispensary location. While dayc carees are not always clearly defined in the statute, we strongly believe the spirit and intent of the law are to protect places where young children congregate daily. Three, school bus activity year round. This block is a daily pickup and drop off zone for multiple private schools and summer programs throughout the year, especially in the mornings and afternoons. School buses stop directly in front of the proposed location. Families rely on this safe and accessible area as a designated loading zone. The presence of a dispensary in this exact location will disrupt that pattern and pose a real safety and environmental concern during the school year. This location serves as a pickup point for students attending Riverdale Country School, St. Ignatius Loyola School, the Hesshel School, and others. In the summer months, children attending Mohawk day camp and similar programs are also picked up and dropped off drop off tier. Number four, community impact. This corner is a central gathering space in our residential neighborhood. It's surrounded by homes, long-standing merchants like Health Source Pharmacy and Family oriented services. Locating a cannabis dispensary at this intersection is entirely misaligned with the needs and character of the Sutton Place community. We understand the need for licensed dispensaries and support responsible cannabis where appropriate, but this location directly across from a school, daycare, and active school bus corridor clearly fails to meet the legal requirements and community standards we should all expect. We ur we respectfully urge CB6 to vote against supporting this application and to advocate that the Office of Cannabis Management reject any attempt to license a dispensary at 998 or 10001st Avenue. Thank you for your time and for standing with us to protect the integrity and safety of our neighborhood. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Thank you, Miss Anzas. next on the list is Ishan Gandhi, a resident of this district who wishes to propose who speak wishes to speak about eating birds on East 54th Street between 2nd and 3rd avenues. Ishan Gandhi, are you here? I don't see anyone. So we'll move on. the next speaker on the list is Alexandra Marquez Oaks, a resident of this district who wishes to speak to the board about there seems to be a typo here. The Sulk School, I think is what they're trying to say. so is that speaker here?</p>
        <p>I see. Yes. All right. Miss Marquez, you have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Good evening and thank you members of community board 6 for allowing me the time to speak. I'm a parent at Sulk School of Science, a small high-erforming middle school. Sulk is both academically rigorous and deeply nurturing qualities that make it one of the most sought-after public schools in the city with a consistently long weight list and a strong reputation built over decades. Just before the summer break, the superintendent of district 2 introduced a proposed merger between SulkQ and the underenrolled Morton school in the West Village. The stated reason was to comply with the new class- size law. However, based on what has been shared so far, it is clear that no alternatives have been seriously considered. This proposal came as a shock to our community. Sulkq has long been an anchor in the district, a place where local families know their children will be challenged, supported, and inspired. The proposed merger not only jeopardizes that, but it also threatens to displace a successful school from the very community it serves. We are asking for your support in protecting Salt's future. We believe this school deserves stability and ultimately a building of its own, not a forced merger that puts it its success at risk. Thank you again for your time and your attention to this important issue.</p>
        <p>Thank you Miss Marquez for your remarks. we'll move on next to Shawa who is a parent of a student at the Sulk School as well and wishes to speak on this same issue. is Shawa here? I see them online. Yes. All right. You have three minutes to make your remarks. You may begin now. Thank you CB6 for allowing me to</p>
        <p>speak and for hearing us out. I echo my fellow parent Alexandra's words. this is against a merger that has been proposed for Salt School of Science with Morton on the west side. in June we heard about the potential merger initially not through the DOE but through thirdparty sources and finally when the news was shared by the DOE there was no discrete plan of what were the proposed steps to preserve what Salt stands for. Like Alex has said has a rigorous academic curriculum. It's a nurturing small school with great teachers, leadership, administration, and a very, very tight-knit community. Most importantly, SALK has been awarded the blue ribbon award this year, and it just received the National Education Award of Excellence from Motive Awards. What this merger or merger with any school threatens is this community, the school, the leadership, the administration. Salt needs to be celebrated. Salt needs to be built up on. Salt does not need to be merged with any school. What we are proposing is to look at other avenues to see if salt can get its own independent building and grow where more kids and families can benefit from. What has also been done to support this has been a petition filed by parents in change.org which has currently received more than 1,200 signatures. The children have signed a petition which is going to be submitted to the DOE and to the current administration and the incoming administration. We can use all support from our community from our leadership to prevent a merger of Sulkq with any other school but to give what Sulk is due its own independent building and a chance to grow. so more kids and families can gain from this. And again, thank you for giving us the time and hearing us out.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your remarks. That that concludes the speakers list tonight. Great. Thank you everyone.</p>
