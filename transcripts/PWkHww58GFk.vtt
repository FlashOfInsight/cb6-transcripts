00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
make quorum. Let's start with that. And
 

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.789 align:start position:0%
make quorum. Let's start with that. And
if<00:20:33.440><c> it's</c><00:20:33.600><c> hard</c><00:20:33.760><c> to</c><00:20:33.919><c> make</c><00:20:34.080><c> quum</c><00:20:34.480><c> because</c>

if it's hard to make quum because

members aren't being replaced and I
 

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
members aren't being replaced and I
think<00:20:37.120><c> it</c><00:20:37.360><c> also</c><00:20:37.679><c> goes</c><00:20:38.000><c> to</c><00:20:38.880><c> the</c><00:20:39.360><c> initial</c>

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%

we can but it you know and I think it's

we can but it you know and I think it's
is<00:30:09.279><c> hard</c><00:30:09.520><c> to</c><00:30:09.760><c> do</c><00:30:10.640><c> and</c><00:30:11.039><c> kind</c><00:30:11.520><c> basically</c><00:30:11.919><c> has</c><00:30:12.080><c> a</c>

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.950 align:start position:0%
to plan ahead they increase their capac

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think that with any legislation you
 

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I think that with any legislation you

have to start somewhere. So this will be

an ever evolving target much like the

the<01:28:09.679><c> question</c><01:28:09.920><c> was</c><01:28:10.080><c> that</c><01:28:10.480><c> the</c><01:28:10.719><c> trees</c><01:28:10.960><c> aren't</c>

01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
the question was that the trees aren't

the question was that the trees aren't

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
the same width or the same

01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; they're not the same. It's not
universal.<01:28:15.679><c> So</c><01:28:15.840><c> I'm</c><01:28:16.080><c> curious</c><01:28:16.400><c> about</c><01:28:16.639><c> the</c>

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
universal. So I'm curious about the
 

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.990 align:start position:0%
universal. So I'm curious about the
width<01:28:17.360><c> if</c><01:28:17.600><c> you're</c><01:28:18.000><c> standing</c><01:28:18.480><c> by</c><01:28:19.360><c> what</c><01:28:19.760><c> does</c>

01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
width if you're standing by what does
 

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.510 align:start position:0%
width if you're standing by what does
that<01:28:20.320><c> entail</c><01:28:21.360><c> and</c><01:28:21.600><c> then</c><01:28:21.760><c> I</c><01:28:22.000><c> guess</c><01:28:22.480><c> part</c><01:28:22.800><c> two</c><01:28:23.199><c> is</c>

01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
that entail and then I guess part two is
 

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
that entail and then I guess part two is
in<01:28:23.760><c> the</c><01:28:24.000><c> resolution</c><01:28:24.480><c> itself</c><01:28:25.040><c> reference</c><01:28:26.320><c> um</c>

01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the resolution itself reference um
 

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
in the resolution itself reference um

&gt;&gt; Yeah.<01:28:32.639><c> Um</c><01:28:33.120><c> so</c><01:28:33.520><c> I</c><01:28:33.679><c> don't</c><01:28:33.840><c> think</c><01:28:33.920><c> we</c><01:28:34.080><c> have</c>

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um so I don't think we have
 

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.030 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um so I don't think we have

with<01:28:37.360><c> designs.</c><01:28:38.159><c> Uh</c><01:28:38.480><c> so</c><01:28:38.639><c> we</c><01:28:38.800><c> ask</c><01:28:39.120><c> basically</c><01:28:39.440><c> for</c>

01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
with designs. Uh so we ask basically for
 

01:28:39.679 --> 01:28:41.510 align:start position:0%
with designs. Uh so we ask basically for
department<01:28:39.920><c> of</c><01:28:40.000><c> transportation</c><01:28:40.560><c> to</c><01:28:41.280><c> take</c><01:28:41.440><c> a</c>

01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
create a curb space for people and then
 

01:29:40.639 --> 01:29:42.790 align:start position:0%
create a curb space for people and then
put<01:29:40.880><c> the</c><01:29:41.040><c> bike</c><01:29:41.360><c> lane</c><01:29:41.760><c> a</c><01:29:42.000><c> little</c><01:29:42.159><c> farther</c><01:29:42.560><c> off</c>

01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
put the bike lane a little farther off
 

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.070 align:start position:0%
put the bike lane a little farther off

01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
Hispanic pedestrian space is something
 

01:29:49.199 --> 01:29:53.669 align:start position:0%
Hispanic pedestrian space is something
that<01:29:50.000><c> uh</c><01:29:50.159><c> we</c><01:29:50.320><c> we</c><01:29:50.639><c> talk</c><01:29:50.800><c> a</c><01:29:50.960><c> lot</c><01:29:51.120><c> about</c><01:29:51.840><c> uh</c>

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.790 align:start position:0%
generally we're talking about tightening
trains.<01:30:06.000><c> So</c><01:30:06.400><c> these</c><01:30:06.639><c> side</c><01:30:06.880><c> streets</c><01:30:07.280><c> have</c><01:30:08.560><c> as</c>

01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
trains. So these side streets have as
 

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.189 align:start position:0%
trains. So these side streets have as
you<01:30:09.199><c> only</c><01:30:09.440><c> so</c><01:30:09.600><c> much</c><01:30:09.760><c> width</c><01:30:10.159><c> and</c><01:30:10.800><c> uh</c><01:30:10.960><c> we're</c>

01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
you only so much width and uh we're

01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
curve space was the pedestrian space and
 

01:30:47.199 --> 01:30:49.830 align:start position:0%
curve space was the pedestrian space and

there's a similar problem on the bus way
bus<01:36:48.639><c> lanes.</c><01:36:49.440><c> Um</c><01:36:49.679><c> I</c><01:36:49.920><c> think</c><01:36:50.159><c> solution</c><01:36:50.639><c> like</c><01:36:50.880><c> bus</c>

01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%

01:36:51.199 --> 01:36:53.830 align:start position:0%

ways<01:36:51.600><c> where</c><01:36:51.760><c> we</c><01:36:51.920><c> have</c><01:36:52.480><c> the</c><01:36:52.880><c> the</c><01:36:53.040><c> roadway</c><01:36:53.440><c> fully</c>

01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%

01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
think is great. Obviously you can't do
 

01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:08.229 align:start position:0%
think is great. Obviously you can't do

&gt;&gt; Yeah.<01:37:10.560><c> Um</c><01:37:11.520><c> I</c><01:37:11.840><c> think</c><01:37:12.400><c> um</c><01:37:12.639><c> some</c><01:37:12.800><c> of</c><01:37:12.880><c> the</c><01:37:12.960><c> things</c>

01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I think um some of the things
 

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.189 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I think um some of the things
that<01:37:13.199><c> we</c><01:37:13.360><c> have</c><01:37:13.520><c> also</c><01:37:13.760><c> done</c><01:37:14.000><c> and</c><01:37:14.320><c> supported</c><01:37:14.719><c> is</c>

01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
that we have also done and supported is
 

01:37:15.199 --> 01:37:17.189 align:start position:0%
that we have also done and supported is
having<01:37:15.520><c> offset</c><01:37:16.080><c> bus</c><01:37:16.320><c> lanes.</c><01:37:16.719><c> So</c><01:37:16.800><c> when</c><01:37:17.040><c> you</c>

01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
having offset bus lanes. So when you
 

01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:18.870 align:start position:0%
having offset bus lanes. So when you
don't<01:37:17.440><c> have</c><01:37:17.760><c> the</c><01:37:18.000><c> bus</c><01:37:18.239><c> lane</c><01:37:18.400><c> right</c><01:37:18.560><c> at</c><01:37:18.719><c> the</c>

01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the bus lane right at the
 

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:19.750 align:start position:0%
don't have the bus lane right at the

&gt;&gt; uh<01:37:19.840><c> that</c><01:37:20.080><c> helps</c><01:37:20.400><c> to</c><01:37:20.800><c> uh</c><01:37:21.040><c> alleviate</c><01:37:21.520><c> some</c><01:37:21.679><c> of</c>

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; uh that helps to uh alleviate some of

01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
I think
 

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.709 align:start position:0%
I think
in<01:37:31.040><c> the</c><01:37:31.199><c> spring</c><01:37:31.440><c> where</c><01:37:31.679><c> we'll</c><01:37:31.840><c> have</c><01:37:32.320><c> uh</c><01:37:32.480><c> two</c>

01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
in the spring where we'll have uh two
 

01:37:32.719 --> 01:37:35.510 align:start position:0%

01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
Avenue north um 42nd Street I believe.
 

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.870 align:start position:0%
Avenue north um 42nd Street I believe.
&gt;&gt; Uh<01:37:40.480><c> I</c><01:37:40.639><c> think</c><01:37:40.719><c> it's</c><01:37:40.880><c> on</c><01:37:41.040><c> the</c><01:37:41.119><c> west</c><01:37:41.360><c> side</c><01:37:41.760><c> of</c><01:37:42.000><c> the</c>

01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Uh I think it's on the west side of the
 

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Uh I think it's on the west side of the

01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
north at 34.
 

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:47.750 align:start position:0%
north at 34.
&gt;&gt; It<01:37:45.040><c> doesn't</c><01:37:45.280><c> matter.</c>

01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.
 

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.709 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.
So,<01:37:48.159><c> uh</c><01:37:48.239><c> I</c><01:37:48.560><c> think</c><01:37:48.880><c> there's</c><01:37:49.199><c> a</c><01:37:49.360><c> number</c><01:37:49.520><c> of</c><01:37:50.159><c> u</c>

01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
So, uh I think there's a number of u
 

01:37:50.719 --> 01:37:51.990 align:start position:0%
So, uh I think there's a number of u
different<01:37:50.960><c> ways</c><01:37:51.199><c> that</c><01:37:51.360><c> we</c><01:37:51.600><c> attack</c><01:37:51.840><c> that</c>

01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
different ways that we attack that
 

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.910 align:start position:0%
different ways that we attack that
problem,<01:37:52.239><c> but</c><01:37:52.480><c> I</c><01:37:52.560><c> agree</c><01:37:53.199><c> uh</c><01:37:53.440><c> it's</c><01:37:53.679><c> something</c>

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
problem, but I agree uh it's something
 

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.070 align:start position:0%
problem, but I agree uh it's something
that<01:37:54.000><c> we</c><01:37:54.159><c> need</c><01:37:54.320><c> to</c><01:37:55.119><c> keep</c><01:37:55.360><c> seeing.</c>

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep seeing.
 

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep seeing.
&gt;&gt; I<01:37:56.239><c> like</c><01:37:56.400><c> the</c><01:37:56.560><c> idea</c><01:37:56.719><c> of</c><01:37:56.880><c> having</c><01:37:57.360><c> space,</c><01:37:57.840><c> you</c>

01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I like the idea of having space, you
 

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.669 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I like the idea of having space, you
know,<01:37:58.159><c> like</c><01:37:58.639><c> the</c><01:37:58.880><c> bus</c><01:37:59.119><c> lane</c><01:37:59.760><c> one</c><01:38:00.000><c> space</c><01:38:00.320><c> over.</c>

01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
know, like the bus lane one space over.
 

01:38:01.679 --> 01:38:04.550 align:start position:0%
know, like the bus lane one space over.
&gt;&gt; Uh<01:38:01.920><c> yeah,</c><01:38:02.480><c> and</c><01:38:02.960><c> uh</c><01:38:03.119><c> we</c><01:38:03.440><c> recently</c><01:38:03.760><c> saw</c><01:38:04.000><c> that</c>

&gt;&gt; Uh yeah, and uh we recently saw that
 

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.109 align:start position:0%

01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
bus lane is really getting used. It's
 

01:38:38.159 --> 01:38:41.910 align:start position:0%
bus lane is really getting used. It's
It's<01:38:38.560><c> so</c><01:38:38.960><c> great</c><01:38:39.440><c> to</c><01:38:39.760><c> see</c><01:38:40.800><c> and</c><01:38:41.119><c> I</c><01:38:41.440><c> don't</c><01:38:41.679><c> feel</c>

It's so great to see and I don't feel
 

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.310 align:start position:0%
It's so great to see and I don't feel

01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
like the Third Avenue traffic, car
 

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
like the Third Avenue traffic, car
traffic<01:38:44.719><c> is</c><01:38:44.960><c> going</c><01:38:45.280><c> slower.</c><01:38:46.400><c> Um,</c><01:38:46.800><c> and</c><01:38:46.960><c> like</c><01:38:47.119><c> I</c>

01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
traffic is going slower. Um, and like I
 

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.590 align:start position:0%
traffic is going slower. Um, and like I
said,<01:38:47.520><c> it's</c><01:38:47.760><c> not</c><01:38:47.920><c> really</c><01:38:48.159><c> our</c><01:38:48.480><c> problem.</c><01:38:49.360><c> So,</c>

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
said, it's not really our problem. So,
 

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
said, it's not really our problem. So,
we<01:38:49.840><c> now</c><01:38:50.080><c> have</c><01:38:50.320><c> bus</c><01:38:50.639><c> lanes</c><01:38:51.119><c> on</c><01:38:51.760><c> first,</c><01:38:52.080><c> second,</c>

01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
we now have bus lanes on first, second,
 

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:58.070 align:start position:0%
we now have bus lanes on first, second,

but<01:39:11.360><c> it's</c><01:39:11.760><c> sort</c><01:39:12.000><c> of</c><01:39:12.320><c> absurd</c><01:39:13.280><c> that</c>

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
but it's sort of absurd that
 

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
but it's sort of absurd that

01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; like the east side of of the island is
 

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.669 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; like the east side of of the island is
so<01:39:20.159><c> well</c><01:39:20.560><c> served</c><01:39:21.040><c> and</c><01:39:21.280><c> the</c><01:39:21.520><c> more</c><01:39:21.840><c> central</c><01:39:22.560><c> area</c>

01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
so well served and the more central area
 

01:39:23.679 --> 01:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
so well served and the more central area
is

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
 

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:37.270 align:start position:0%

01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I'll briefly provide my thoughts on that
 

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.470 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I'll briefly provide my thoughts on that
um<01:41:49.119><c> I</c><01:41:49.360><c> think</c><01:41:49.520><c> one</c><01:41:49.600><c> of</c><01:41:49.679><c> the</c><01:41:49.840><c> ways</c><01:41:50.000><c> in</c><01:41:50.159><c> which</c><01:41:50.239><c> we</c>

01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the ways in which we
 

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.950 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the ways in which we
combat<01:41:51.119><c> bicycle</c><01:41:51.600><c> going</c><01:41:51.840><c> the</c><01:41:51.920><c> wrong</c><01:41:52.080><c> way</c><01:41:52.480><c> is</c><01:41:52.719><c> by</c>

01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
combat bicycle going the wrong way is by
 

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:56.470 align:start position:0%
combat bicycle going the wrong way is by
having<01:41:53.679><c> uh</c><01:41:54.080><c> better</c><01:41:55.119><c> uh</c><01:41:55.360><c> designated</c><01:41:55.920><c> areas</c><01:41:56.239><c> for</c>

01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
having uh better uh designated areas for
 

01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:58.229 align:start position:0%
having uh better uh designated areas for

01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
cyclists to go the right way. So, I
 

01:41:58.239 --> 01:42:00.629 align:start position:0%
cyclists to go the right way. So, I
think<01:41:58.400><c> having</c><01:41:58.719><c> bike</c><01:41:58.960><c> lanes</c><01:41:59.199><c> on</c><01:41:59.360><c> Third</c><01:41:59.600><c> Avenue,</c>

01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%

01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
that not only will it succeed but uh if
 

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.310 align:start position:0%
that not only will it succeed but uh if

And<02:05:13.920><c> so</c><02:05:15.360><c> um</c><02:05:15.920><c> I</c><02:05:16.239><c> think</c><02:05:16.400><c> we</c><02:05:17.360><c> felt</c><02:05:18.000><c> overall</c><02:05:19.119><c> that</c>

02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
And so um I think we felt overall that
 

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:25.270 align:start position:0%
And so um I think we felt overall that
the<02:05:20.880><c> uh</c><02:05:21.280><c> penalties</c><02:05:22.560><c> if</c><02:05:22.880><c> you</c><02:05:23.840><c> lose</c>

02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
get to one of these trials. So, the
 

02:07:22.719 --> 02:07:25.270 align:start position:0%
get to one of these trials. So, the
impact<02:07:23.520><c> sounds</c><02:07:23.920><c> like</c><02:07:24.079><c> it's</c><02:07:24.400><c> serious,</c><02:07:24.960><c> but</c>

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
impact sounds like it's serious, but
 

02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:29.109 align:start position:0%
impact sounds like it's serious, but
it's<02:07:25.679><c> probably</c><02:07:26.239><c> pretty</c><02:07:27.280><c> um</c><02:07:27.520><c> pretty</c><02:07:27.840><c> minimal.</c>

02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%

would not be
 

02:08:10.159 --> 02:08:13.510 align:start position:0%
would not be
&gt;&gt; Yeah.<02:08:10.719><c> allowable</c><02:08:11.599><c> because</c><02:08:12.000><c> to</c><02:08:12.320><c> me</c><02:08:13.040><c> you</c><02:08:13.280><c> have</c>

02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. allowable because to me you have
 

02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:16.629 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. allowable because to me you have
to<02:08:13.679><c> be</c><02:08:13.920><c> responsible</c><02:08:14.639><c> for</c><02:08:15.040><c> the</c><02:08:16.079><c> crimes</c><02:08:16.480><c> that</c>

02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for the crimes that
 

02:08:16.639 --> 02:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for the crimes that
are<02:08:16.800><c> that</c><02:08:17.280><c> dramatic.</c><02:08:17.920><c> And</c><02:08:18.480><c> so</c><02:08:18.719><c> I</c><02:08:19.040><c> think</c>

02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
are that dramatic. And so I think
 

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:23.750 align:start position:0%
are that dramatic. And so I think
we're<02:08:20.880><c> not</c><02:08:21.119><c> going</c><02:08:21.360><c> to</c><02:08:22.480><c> decide</c><02:08:22.800><c> to</c><02:08:23.119><c> go</c><02:08:23.520><c> to</c>

02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to decide to go to
 

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:25.589 align:start position:0%
we're not going to decide to go to

treatment court. [laughter]
And<02:08:25.840><c> I</c><02:08:26.159><c> think</c><02:08:26.320><c> this</c><02:08:26.719><c> is</c><02:08:27.040><c> mostly</c><02:08:27.440><c> about</c>

02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
And I think this is mostly about
 

02:08:27.679 --> 02:08:30.229 align:start position:0%
And I think this is mostly about
expanding<02:08:28.320><c> it</c><02:08:28.480><c> more</c><02:08:28.800><c> to</c><02:08:29.040><c> the</c><02:08:29.199><c> mentally</c><02:08:29.920><c> ill</c>

02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
expanding it more to the mentally ill
 

02:08:30.239 --> 02:08:32.950 align:start position:0%

02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
 

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
And<02:12:42.159><c> just</c><02:12:42.480><c> a</c><02:12:42.719><c> heads</c><02:12:42.960><c> up,</c><02:12:43.280><c> it</c><02:12:43.520><c> turns</c><02:12:43.679><c> out</c><02:12:43.840><c> that</c>

02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
And just a heads up, it turns out that
 

02:12:44.159 --> 02:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
And just a heads up, it turns out that
faith-based<02:12:44.880><c> housing</c><02:12:45.199><c> is</c><02:12:45.520><c> much</c><02:12:45.679><c> more</c>

02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
faith-based housing is much more
 

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.270 align:start position:0%
faith-based housing is much more
controversial<02:12:47.040><c> than</c><02:12:47.760><c> anticipated.</c>

02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
controversial than anticipated.
 

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:52.069 align:start position:0%
controversial than anticipated.
&gt;&gt; So,<02:12:49.599><c> I</c><02:12:49.840><c> think</c><02:12:49.920><c> the</c><02:12:50.239><c> discussion</c><02:12:50.719><c> may</c><02:12:51.360><c> um</c><02:12:51.760><c> be</c><02:12:51.920><c> a</c>

02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So, I think the discussion may um be a
 

02:12:52.079 --> 02:12:54.870 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So, I think the discussion may um be a
bit<02:12:52.239><c> longer</c><02:12:52.960><c> than</c><02:12:53.199><c> we</c><02:12:53.360><c> had</c><02:12:53.679><c> anticipated.</c>

02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
bit longer than we had anticipated.
 

02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:56.550 align:start position:0%
bit longer than we had anticipated.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,<02:12:55.280><c> it's</c><02:12:55.520><c> fascinating.</c>

02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fascinating.
 

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's fascinating.
&gt;&gt; And<02:12:57.040><c> um</c><02:12:57.280><c> it</c><02:12:57.599><c> sounds</c><02:12:57.760><c> like</c><02:12:57.920><c> we</c><02:12:58.079><c> need</c><02:12:58.239><c> some</c><02:12:58.400><c> more</c>

02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And um it sounds like we need some more
 

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; And um it sounds like we need some more
research

02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
